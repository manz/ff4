Gilbert: I don't know...
 He was cloaked completely

 unbelievably powerful.

 We are about to arrive at

Cecil: Yeah...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="32">Soldier: Looks like it's
 bothering the Captain

Soldier: Even if we were
 ordered to do so...


Soldier: Taking the crystal
 from innocent people is...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="33">Soldier: Captain!



Soldier: Why are we going as
 far as pillaging a town of
 Magicians who don't even
 resist!?
Cecil: Listen, everyone!



 His Majesty has decreed
 that possessing the Crystal
 is absolutely necessary.

 The people of Mysidia knew
 too much about the secret
 of the crystal,

 and were a threat to the
 continued sovereignty
 of our country.

 We are the Red Wings,
 the air power of Baron.
 His Majesty's orders
 are absolute...
Soldier: Captain...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="34">Soldier: Captain! Monsters![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="35">Soldier: Agh!
Cecil: Are you all right?


Soldier: There's more of them!Cecil: Damn![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="36">Beyond this point lies our
land, the Zemus Zone...


There's no escape from my
minions! You will not
survive to meet me!

So, weaklings, fade into the
darkness forever!
Mwa ha ha ha ha![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="37">Soldier: Captain!
 We have arrived at Baron!
Cecil: I see...
 Prepare to land.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="38">Beigan: Oh! You have the
 Crystal!


Cecil: The Mysidians...
 They didn't resist at all...


Beigan: What are you saying?
 ...Come, His Majesty is
 waiting.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="39">...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="40">Beigan: Sir Cecil, please
 wait here a moment.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="41">Beigan: Your Majesty...
 It seems Cecil has
 developed a distrust of
 the Throne...
King Baron: Truly?
 Well done, Captain of the
 Guards!

 Thank you for letting me
 know! But all that matters
 is the crystal...
 Call in Cecil.
Beigan: Yes, my liege.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="42">Beigan: Sir Cecil,
 His Majesty awaits.
 Please enter.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="43">King Baron: Well done,
 Cecil.
 So, where is the crystal?

Cecil: My lord, I have it.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="44">You gave the King the
Water Crystal.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="45">Beigan: Hmm...It appears to
 be genuine.
King Baron: It is!

 Oh, how it glimmers...
 like light shining on the
 depths of the sea...

 You may leave, Cecil![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="46">Cecil: ...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="47">Cecil: Your Majesty![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="48">King Baron: Wh..what!?
Beigan: Wh, what is it?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="49">Cecil: Your Majesty, we do
 not understand your motives.
 Why is it you need the
 crystals?
 Was it because the Mysidians
 were becoming a threat?
 Then why didn't they resist?

 We do not understand why
 innocent bystanders had to
 die.

 Some have even wondered
 if your actions are...
 altogether...
 honorable.
King Baron: So you distrust
 your own King, Cecil?!


Cecil: !! No, I didn't
 mean that at all!!


King Baron: Did you think
 that I knew nothing about
 your true feelings!?

 To think that I took you in
 and raised you like a son!
 Now, you can't even
 trust me.
 I can no longer entrust you
 with the command of the
 Red Wings.

 As of now, you are relieved
 of your post![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="50">King Baron: Your new charge
 is to eliminate the Phantom
 Beasts that haunt the upper
 valley![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="51">Cain: Please wait![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="52">Cain: Cecil wasn't...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="53">King Baron: Cain, if you're
 so worried about Cecil,
 then go with him!

Cecil: But your Majesty!



King Baron: I have nothing
 more to say! Here!
 Take this ring and go![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="54">Cecil: Sorry for getting you
 mixed up in all of this,
 Cain.

Cain: Once you defeat those
 Phantom Beasts, His Majesty
 will surely forgive you,

 and you will be reinstated
 as Commander of the
 Red Wings.

Cecil: ...
Cain: You've had a
 long day.

 Leave all the preparations
 to me, and go get some
 rest.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="55">Cain: What's wrong?
Cecil: I'm sorry, Cain...


Cain: Why are you still
 apologizing?
 I defended you out of
 my own free will!
Cecil: It's not that,
 Cain.
 It was my mission today...

 I learned the art of the
 Dark Sword as ordered by
 His Majesty.

 But it should have been to
 defend Baron, and not to
 harm innocent people.

 Maybe apologizing will
 help clear my conscience...


Cain: Don't be so
 hard on yourself.
 I'm sure the king has a good
 reason for his actions.
 He raised us as his own sons. He would never do anything
 less than honorable.

Cecil: Cain, I envy your
 faith in His Majesty.


 He spoke of your father...
 He had the same
 unwavering loyalty...

Cain: My father...
 My father was a
 Dragon Knight as well...

 If I had mastered the art of
 the Dark Sword as the King
 had commanded,

 I probably would have
 advanced up the ranks like
 you...

 However, I felt it was my
 duty to honor my father and
 follow in his path.

 He died while I was still a
 child...Sometimes I wish he
 could see me today.
 I hope he would be proud.
 I often have these moments... moments of quiet reflection
 when I can feel his spirit
 within me, guiding me...
Cecil: ...



Cain: Sorry to have
 rambled on like that...
 That's not like me.

 Anyhow, I wouldn't worry
 too much about today.
 You really should be
 worrying about tomorrow!
 You did what the King wanted
 and became a Dark Knight...


 You have rank and prestige
 over me, but tomorrow we'll
 see who's better... 

 We must get an early start
 tomorrow. Go get some rest.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="56">Rosa: Cecil![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="57">Rosa: Thank God you're
 all right!
 Your mission was so sudden,
 I was worried.
Cecil: We were all right...



 We couldn't get hurt by a
 bunch of Magicians who
 didn't even resist...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="58">Rosa: I'm coming to
 your room again tonight...


Cecil: ...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="59">Cecil: Why is His Majesty
 behaving this way?


 As a Knight he was known
 for his kindness and valor.


 Cain and I were orphans,
 but he took us in and
 raised us like his own sons.
 But now...
 Mysidia's Crystal...
 Is it something so necessary
 that we must take it by force from innocent villagers?
 To think that we would
 do such a thing,
 even under orders!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="60">Rosa: What happened?



 One second you're being sent
 to Mysidia, the next you're
 being sent off to kill some
 ghastly monsters.
 And you've been acting
 strange since you
 came back.

Cecil: No, it's nothing...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="61">Rosa: Then please don't
 look away...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="62">Cecil: In Mysidia...



 I killed innocent people,
 plundered their village,
 and stole their crystal,
 all for what?!
 Why did I do such a thing?
 It's as if my heart has
 become as dark as my armor![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="63">Rosa: ...You're not
 like that.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="64">Cecil: I'm just a spineless
 Dark Knight, just a pawn
 of the King...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="65">Rosa: The Cecil of
 the Red Wings I know would
 never whimper like that!

 Not the Cecil I love...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="66">Rosa: You're going to Mist
 tomorrow, right?


 If anything happens to you,
 I...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="67">Cecil: ...Cain is coming
 with me...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="68">Cecil: It's late now...
 Get some rest.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="69">Rosa: Be careful!
 For my sake...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="70">Cecil: Thanks, Rosa...
 But I'm only a Dark Knight... 

 What can I do?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="71">Cecil: Yang! You're alive!
Yang: You!


Cecil: You don't
 recognize me?
 It's me, Cecil!
 I became a Paladin...
Yang: Cecil!
 I've been looking for you!


 Traitor to the King! Attack!
Soldiers: Yes sir![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="72">Cecil: Yang,
 don't you recognize me?
Yang: I recognize you,
 you fugitive![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="73">Yang: Sir Cecil!
 What have I done?
 I was knocked out by
 Leviathan...then...
Tella: Baron controlled
 you while you were amnesiac.
Yang: B...Baron?
 I've disgraced myself...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="74">Yang: Rydia was
 swallowed by Leviathan.
 Gilbert...I don't know.
Cecil: Oh...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="75">Yang: Where are we?



Cecil: We're in Baron.
 If the soldiers overhear
 us, we're in trouble.

 There's a quiet room in
 the inn where we can talk.



  Yang has joined the party![music][0x29][delay][0x28][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="76">Yang: And who is this?
Cecil: He's Tella,
 the Sage. Gilbert's...

Tella: My daughter
 sacrificed her life to
 protect...him.
Yang: ...
 I am Yang, captain
 of the Monks at Fabul.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="77">Porom: Palom!
Yang: ...
Cecil: Anyhow,
 we've got to save Cid...
Tella: But it won't be so
 easy to get in the castle...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="78">Cecil: This is the
 key to Baron!


 Yang, they must have given
 it to you when you became
 the leader of the guards!

 With this we might be
 able to do something!


You received the key to Baron![music][0x29][delay][0x28][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="79">The ring is glowing..!?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="80">Cain: What is this!?
Cecil: This is why we
 were sent here...!

Cain: To burn the
 village...!?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="81">Cecil: WHY!?
 King Baron!! NO!!


'Mom! NO..!!' -weep-[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="82">Cecil: Who's that?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="83">Girl: Mom's dragon died,
 so Mom did too...
 -sniff-, -sniff-[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="84">Cecil: Dear God!
Cain: Come to think of it,
 I've heard of this.

 People with the power
 to call monsters...
 They are called Summoners!

Cecil: No!! It can't
 be that us defeating
 that dragon caused this
 girl's mother to die..?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="85">Girl: You guys killed Mom's
 dragon?!
Cecil: We didn't know...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="86">Cain: The King sent us here
 to wipe out the Summoners...
Cecil: Dear God...

Cain: Unfortunately,
 our orders...we have no
 alternative but to
 kill this girl as well.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="87">Cecil: Cain!
Cain: If we disobey the
 King, we'll be executed
 for treason!
Cecil: But she's just a
 child!
Cain: ...Are you saying
 we should defy the King?
Cecil: If he expects
 us to murder like this...
 I have no intention of
 following him!
 I renounce all loyalty to
 the King, to the Red Wings,
 and to Baron!!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="88">Cain: Hmm, I thought you'd
 say that. I won't let you
 oppose the King alone,
 of course.
Cecil: Cain?



Cain: No matter how much I
 owe the King, as a Dragon
 Knight I could never
 perform such a lowly deed.
Cecil: Then you didn't
 really intend to...


Cain: Baron is the
 strongest military power
 in the world.

 Just the two of us
 opposing it would mean
 nothing against their might.

 We must let the other
 countries know about Baron's
 lust for power and enlist
 their aid!
 And we must save Rosa!



Cecil: Thanks, Cain.
Cain: I'm not doing
 this particularly for
 you though, you know.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="89">Cain: Anyway, it's too
 dangerous for us to stay
 here.

 We've got to get out
 of this village. What
 should we do with the
 girl?
Cecil: Only one choice!
 She goes with us![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="90">Cecil: Come on, it's
 dangerous here.
 Come with us.

Girl: No![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="91">Cain: We've got no choice!
 We'll have to force her
 to come with us!

Girl: Don't come any closer![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="92">Cecil: Wait![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="93">Girl: I can't stand it!
 I hate you!
 I hate you all![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="94">Cecil: Phew,
 the girl's all right...


 !!Cain!



 !!Cain!
 Where are you?


 !![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="95">Cecil: I can't stay here
 forever...I've got to get
 out of here...
 Cain...Please be alive![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="96">Cecil: If she doesn't
 get some rest...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="97">Welcome!
Oh no, she looks ill!
Quickly, quickly,
go into the room!
Don't worry about money,
please!


Cecil: Thanks.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="98">Cecil: You've come to...
Girl: ....


Cecil: You haven't
 told me your name yet.
Girl: ....

Cecil: ...I can't ask
 you to forgive me for
 killing your mother.

 But please let me
 protect you...


Girl: ....[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="99">General: We've found you,
 Cecil!!
Girl: !!

Cecil: Wait! The King
 of Baron is...


General: King's orders.
 If you turn over the
 survivor from Mist, he will
 forgive your treachery.
 It has been deemed
 dangerous for the people
 of Mist to even exist!

Cecil: What!?
 Has the King stooped so
 low as to kill children?!
Girl: !!
General: Shut up with the
 lecture and give me the girl! 

Cecil: I refuse![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="100">Girl: I'm sorry, this is
 my fault...


Cecil: I should be the
 one apologizing.
 What I did should not
 be forgotten.
Girl: But...
 you protected me...

<sn:pointer id="104">Rosa: Cecil! You're here!
 I'm so glad...


Cecil: Why did you
 come here?


Rosa: I heard you died in
 the earthquake at Mist...
 But I didn't believe it...

Cecil: Don't worry...
 I'm here...
 Rosa, who is Golbeze?

Rosa: The King of Baron
 called him to take your
 place as the commander of
 the Red Wings.
 Ever since he came,
 King Baron has given
 more and more authority
 to him...
 Golbeze is certainly
 the one influencing
 the King to gather the
 four Crystals.
 The Water Crystal from
 Mysidia...


 The Fire Crystal from
 Damcyan...


 The Wind Crystal from
 Fabul...


 and the Earth Crystal
 from Toroia.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="105">Gilbert: He's taken the
 Fire Crystal...


Cecil: This is Gilbert,
 the prince of Damcyan.
 It's because of him that
 we were able to heal you.
 This girl is Rydia,
 from Mist.


Rydia: Are you OK?
Rosa: I'm better...
 thanks...

 If Damcyan's crystal has
 already been taken
 then Fabul is next!

 We can't let this happen...
 -cough, cough-[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="106">Cecil: Rosa, don't
 overdo it.
 We'll go to Fabul.

Gilbert: But the way to Fabul
 over Hobs Mountain is frozen
 over...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="107">Rosa: ...Rydia,
 can you cast Fire?
Rydia: !

 ...Hmm...no I can't...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="108">Rosa: If you're a Summoner,
 you should be able to cast a
 basic Black Magic spell like
 Fire...-cough-[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="109">Cecil: Rosa! You must rest![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="110">Gilbert: Anna...why did
 you have to leave me..?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="111">Gilbert: Anna!



Anna: Gilbert, I must
 leave...My time has come...
 to become one with an
 eternal spirit...
Gilbert: Anna!
 Please don't go![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="112">Anna: Gilbert, be brave!
 You must not let Golbeze
 gather the Crystals...

 You loved me.
 Now give that love to the
 people of this earth.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="113">Gilbert: Anna,
 I'll fight. But courage...
 Anna, what should I do...?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="114">Tella: Fast asleep
 already...
 Must have been an exhausting
 day for one so young...
 Is this girl...



Cecil: She's a Summoner
 from Mist.


Tella: I sense great
 potential within her.
 She could become quite
 a gifted sorceress...
 ...
 Such a peaceful face...
 So much like Anna when
 she was a child.
Cecil: Anna is...



Tella: My only daughter.
 She eloped to Damcyan with a
 bard because I wouldn't
 consent to their marriage...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="115">Tella: Why are you
 going there?


Cecil: A friend of mine in
 Kaipo has an extremely
 high fever.

Tella: So you're after
 the Light of the Desert...
 Without that, there's
 not much hope...
Cecil: What is the
 monster in this cavern?
Tella: It's a huge creature
 with eight legs.
 In order to save Anna and
 your friend we've got to
 beat it first...

 I hope this horrible feeling
 I have about Damcyan is just
 my imagination, but...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="116">Cid: What're y'all
 worrying about?
 I'll be back soon!

 Just sit tight and wait
 like good little children![end]</sn:pointer>

 Don't be falling for me now![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="118">Cecil: King Jiott.

King Fabul: What!?
 Can this be so?
Yang: These people
 came to let us know.
King Fabul: Who are they?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="124">Cecil: There's not much
 time.
 We must fortify the castle!

King Fabul: Wait a minute!
 You're a Dark Knight

 Can I trust you?
Yang: Your Highness!
 They saved me from
 Golbeze's minions on the
 mountain!
Cecil: Time is of the
 essence!
 We must prepare for battle!
Rosa: Please hurry![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="125">Gilbert: It's been quite
 a while, King Fabul.
King Fabul: Prince Gilbert!

Yang: You'll have to come
 through me first![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="142">'NO!! STOP!'[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="143">Cain: ...Rosa..?
Rosa: Cain, no!!


Cain: Urg..agh..!
 Don't..look...at...me![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="144">What's troubling you, Cain?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="145">Gilbert: Golbeze!
Cecil: You're Golbeze...!


Golbeze: So you're Cecil...
 Perfect setting for
 introductions,
 don't you think?
 Well, perfect for me, at
 least. You're sprawled on
 the ground and I'm about
 to take the crystal.
Gilbert: Cecil!
Yang: Over my dead body![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="146">Golbeze: That's the whole
 idea.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="147">Golbeze: Cain...
 Stop standing around
 and get the Crystal.
Cain: Yes, Master![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="148">Rosa: Stop, Cain!
Cain: !
Cecil: Stay away, Rosa!!

Golbeze: I get it...
 This girl is dear to you.
 So I'll take her.

 It's been a pleasure
 defeating you. We must
 do it again sometime.

 And since I have this girl,
 there'll be a next time...


 Let's go, Cain![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="149">Cain: Looks like you
 get to live a bit longer,
 Cecil![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="150">Cecil: Wa..it![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="151">Cecil: Agh...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="152">Rydia: Cure![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="153">Rydia: Are you all right?
Gilbert: ...
 Rosa... kidnapped.

Yang: ...We couldn't
 protect the crystal...
 I...failed...

Cecil: Rosa...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="154">Rydia: Hey! Don't give up
 so easily!
 Rosa's gonna be all right...

 And we can get back
 the Crystal![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="155">Gilbert: ...That's right![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="156">Sir Yang, you must be
tired. Please rest.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="157">Gilbert: Rosa... In order
 to fight Golbeze, we're
 going to need an airship.
 But only Baron has them...
Yang: I wonder if there's
 any way to sneak into
 Baron...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="158">Cecil: As Baron's
 military strength lies in
 the Red Wings, their navy
 is comparatively weak.
 If we're going to sneak in
 we'll have to do it by sea.
Rydia: Then we're
 going to need a ship.
Yang: Let's ask the King
 first thing tomorrow
 morning.

 You came to his aid in
 a time of need.
 The King will most
 certainly grant you one.
Cecil: Please...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="159">Yang: Who was that
 Dragon Knight?


Cecil: He's Cain, and he
 is...was...my rival and...
 best friend.

 We vowed to escape Baron
 together...
Yang: Really...

Gilbert: In any case,
 let's rest easy tonight.
Cecil: ...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="160">Yang's wife: Dear!
 Be sure to show those
 bastards how much we
 like invasions!
Yang: Yes Ma'am!
Yang's wife: All of
 you, please be careful!

Cecil: Yes Ma'am![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="161">Captain: So you're Cecil!
 I've heard about you!


 Just sit back and relax.
 We'll be at Baron before
 you know it!

 All right, cast off, mates![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="162">Captain: We'll thank those
 bastards for attacking our
 homes!
Sailors: 'Aye Captain!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="163">Yang: So, what do you
 intend to do once you
 reach Baron?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="164">Cecil: What the--?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="165">Sailor: It can't be![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="166">Captain: You scurvy dogs!
 Stop screaming like women
 and DO SOMETHING![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="167">Rydia: Kyaa-![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="178">Palom: No problem-o![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="179">Golbeze: Come, Scarmiglione![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="180">Scarmiglione: -Gurgle-...
 Scarmiglione of Earth...
 at your service...

Golbeze: That Cecil
 could be a problem.
 We should get rid of him
 before he becomes one.
 He's a Dark Knight, so he
 should be powerless against
 your undead. But he's
 climbing Mount Ordeals.
Scarmiglione: Then...
 he intends to become...
 -hiss-..a Paladin.

Golbeze: Obviously, you must
 kill him before he does.


Scarmiglione: Do not worry.
 You can enjoy watching his
 death, Lord Golbeze.

Golbeze: Then go!
Scarmiglione: Yes...my Master![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="181">Golbeze: This has become
 interesting...
 Don't you think so, Cain?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="182">Cain: Yes..
 But you should not take
 light of Cecil's power...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="183">Cain: My Master!
 Let me kill him![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="184">Golbeze: Yeah, like you
 did at Fabul?
 Oh, wait...You didn't
 kill him there...
 So what makes you think
 I'll send you?
 Stay here and watch the girl.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="185">Tella: So you're here to
 search for Meteo as well?
Cecil: Meteo?

Porom: Meteo? You're..
Palom: Hey, old man!
 Are you Tella?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="186">Porom: Call him Master
 Tella! You're so rude![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="187">Porom: It truly is an honor
 to meet you, Master Tella.


 We have been sent by the
 village elder of Mysidia

Palom: Spy on...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="189">Porom: Ahem!
 We are to guide Mr. Cecil
 through Mount Ordeals.
 My name is Porom.
Palom: I'm Palom!
 So you're Tella!
 You're real famous in
 Mysidia![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="190">Tella: So these are
 children from Mysidia.
 What happened to Gilbert
 and Rydia?
Cecil: When we were going to
 Baron, we were attacked by
 Leviathan...
Tella: ...They died!?
Cecil: Yes...
 And Rosa was captured
 by Golbeze...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="191">Palom: That's gotta be his
 woman![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="192">Porom: Hush!
Cecil: But weren't you
 going to find Golbeze?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="193">Tella: I can't beat someone
 as powerful as him with just
 the magic I have now.

 I was searching for the
 legendary sealed magic
 Meteo...

 and I felt a strong aura
 coming from this mountain!
 Could it be, after all these
 years of searching...?
Porom: That spell is
 dangerous! If someone who
 has lived as long as you
 tries to cast it...
Tella: Yes, I am old! But!
 Even if it means losing my
 life...

 I must avenge my daughter...! 


Cecil: ....[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="194">Palom: Hmph!
 This is why adults are such
 a pain in the ass![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="195">Palom: Who IS this Golbeze?!
Porom: You're so ignorant!
 He's the one controlling
 Baron![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="196">'-Gurgle-....'



Tella: An evil presence!!



'I'm happy...very happy...
 Killing makes me happy!'


Cecil: Who's there!?[end]</sn:pointer>

 I'm sorry...
 for my weakness...
 If I wasn't so...
 Anna...would be alive...



Tella: ...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="214">Yang: Sir Gilbert,
 you must care for yourself
 at the moment.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="215">Gilbert: Yang...
 You're also safe.
 Then Rydia is too...?

Yang: I..I couldn't save
 her...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="216">Gilbert: Oh...that's
 horrible...
 

 To make matters worse...
 while everyone is fighting
 I'm stuck here in bed...[end]</sn:pointer>

Cecil: Gilbert!
 It's all thanks to you!
Gilbert: No, not really...
Cid: But why did that
 song affect him?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="227">Gilbert: While wandering
 as a bard, I learned songs
 that warded off evil
 fairies and spirits.
 I thought that song
 might work. It did...

 that you saved us.
Gilbert: No...it wasn't
 me...ugh![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="228">Gilbert: Master Tella...
Tella: I know now why
 Anna loved you...

 She must have been so

 avenge Anna's death
 with Meteo!
 And I will fight 
 for you as well.
Gilbert: Thank you...

Cecil: Gilbert, you are...
 a brave man!

 said...


 Give your love to the

 you've got the crystal...


Tella: Show yourself!

 soon enough.

Golbeze: I'm on the top
 floor of this tower
 with Rosa...
 As thanks for saving me an
 invasion, I'll exchange her
 for the Crystal of Earth.

Cecil: Golbeze, you bastard!



Golbeze: Of course...



 being the bad guy that I am,

 Now, give me the crystal.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="260">Barbariccia: Cain,
 you betrayed me...us!
 After what we gave you?
 Why?
 We're both creatures of
 the sky!


Cain: Barbariccia,
 I did not betray anything,
 except my honor.

Barbariccia: To think I
 prevented Lord Golbeze
 from killing you, because
 of a weak human emotion...
 The old mage with Meteo
 is dead. I'll send all
 of you to your deaths!

Cain: You're not the
 only one who can fight
 in the air...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="261">Barbariccia: ...Cain...
 It...wasn't supposed to end
 this way...

 There's something I need
 to talk to you about.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="265">Cid: Aaaah, needed to take
 a load off...
 What is it, Cain?

Cain: It concerns the
 Crystals.


Cecil: The crystal
 from Toroia was taken...
 which means that he's
 taken all the crystals.
Cain: No, he only has
 four of them.
Rosa: So four isn't all
 of them...?
Cid: So the rumor is
 true?!
Rosa: It can't be...

Cain: Right...
 The Crystals of Darkness![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="266">Cid: There are four
 crystals on the front
 side of the Earth.

Yang: So there are
 crystals on the reverse..?
Cecil: The Crystals of
 Darkness...?
Cain: Right.
 Most importantly, it
 means that Golbeze has
 only half of the crystals.
Cid: So the Crystals of
 Darkness aren't a rumor...
 Here's an obvious question... Where are they?
Cain: Golbeze knows where
 they are.
Cecil: We must hurry!
 Where are they?
Cain: On the opposite side
 of the face of the earth.
 Literally, the underground.

Cid: How the hell
 do we get there?
 Dig a hole or something?

Cain: I don't know...
 At any rate, Golbeze said
 that when the crystals from
 the front and back...
 of Light and Darkness...
 are all gathered, the
 way to the moon would open.

Cecil: Way to the moon?



Cain: I'm not quite sure
 what that means... but
 apparently this item could
 be useful in our quest.
 Here, take it.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="267">Received the Magma Stone.



Cecil: What's this?
Cain: This stone
 apparently opens the
 way to the underground.
Yang: Where?
Rosa: Where would this be?
Cain: I don't know...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="268">Cecil: The Magma stone
 is reddening![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="269">Cecil: What's that!?
Cain: The Red Wings![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="270">Cid: Does it hurt,
 Enterprise?
 Hang in there, baby!
 Daddy's here...
Cecil: We're going to crash![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="271">Dwarf King: Oh, you're
 all right!
Cecil: And you are?

Dwarf King: I'm the leader of
 the Underground, the
 Dwarf King Jiott.

Cecil: Where are the
 Crystals of Darkness?
Jiott: So that's what
 they came for.
 We thought you were with
 them, but then they shot
 you down.

 Actually, we were about to
 shoot you down ourselves.


Cain: Are the underground
 Crystals safe?


Jiott: Unfortunately,
 they've already gotten
 two of the four.
Yang: We're late...
Jiott: But the crystal in
 this castle is still safe.


 We managed to drive those,
 uh, contraptions back with
 the Dwarf tanks.

Rosa: So those were your
 tanks fighting with the
 airships.

Jiott: Oh, so you call
 those things airships...
 Wow, the upper world has
 things like that!
 We're really proud of our
 tanks, but they were hurting
 us badly with their attacks.

 Would you assist us with
 your airship?


Cid: Well, I'd like to
 help, but after that volley
 and crash, it isn't going to
 do anyone much good at all.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="272">Cecil: Cid![end]</sn:pointer>

'Well, well, well...'[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="278">Cecil: Golbeze...!



Golbeze: Look who decided to
 show up. I really must thank
 you for the other day.

 How could you possibly know
 that I love having meteors
 dropped on my head?

 But now that old bastard
 is dead...


 Before I unmercifully and
 painfully slaughter you,
 wouldn't you like to know why I'm gathering the crystals?
 It is said that when all
 eight Crystals of the Earth,
 both the Light and the
 Darkness, are gathered,
 the way to the Moon will
 open...


Cecil: Way to the moon?
Golbeze: Unimaginable
 power awaits there...

 To think I could become a
 deity! But, of course,
 you stand in my way.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="279">Cecil: We defeated him!
 We defeated Golbeze![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="280">Rosa: Thanks to you!
 Rydia!
 You're so different!

Cecil: How...Why...
 When...You grew up?


Rydia: When I was swallowed
 by Leviathan he took me
 to the Phantom World.

Cecil: Leviathan,
 a Phantom Beast...?


Rydia: Oh, I can remember
 how terrified I was.
 I couldn't even scream...

 But he spoke to me
 telepathically.
 He told me to be brave.
 Their world is so different!
 The Phantom Beasts
 befriended me and trained
 me in Black Magic.

 I can't use White Magic
 any more, but my summoning
 power increased tenfold!

 The time flow in the Phantom
 World is different...
Rosa: And that's why you've
 grown up this fast?
Cain: Cecil, who is she?
Cecil: It's Rydia,
 from the village of Mist.

Cain: That child!?
 She's grown into...
Yang: From a child
 into a beautiful woman!
Cecil: Rydia, why are
 you helping us?
 Your mother...I...

Rydia: Cecil, if you
 only knew what I have
 learned since then...

 The Queen of the
 Phantom World told me
 of a great evil at work...

 I must stand up and
 be counted among the
 righteous.
 I'll fight with you!

 Damn, I hate being so good!'


Rosa: Cid![end]</sn:pointer>

 Where's Yang?

Cid: Is that so...
 Yang...

<sn:pointer id="296">Rosa: Cid!
Rydia: Why is everyone...


Cain: Damnit...
 everyone's dying...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="297">Mr. Cecil! Boss asked us to
attach this hook to the

Don't worry, it'll only
take a sec![end]</sn:pointer>

'Rest assured he's not

'Well, we're done here!
 Be careful!'[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="300">Man: I finally found you,
 Rubicante!
 I've been waiting for this

Rubicante: Hmm...have I met
 you before?


Man: I'm the Prince of Eblana! The Master Ninja Edge!


Rubicante: Eblana?
 Where is that?


Edge: Don't you dare
 insult me like that,
 you bastard![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="301">Cecil: Are you all right!?
Edge: I lost...
 AAARRRRRGggg...hhh...ouch...

Rydia: Rubicante stands
 between us and the Crystals.
 Maybe we could help
 each other.
Edge: Don't get in the way!
 This is personal!
Cecil: You went up against
 Rubicante alone...
Cain: And look what happened!
 So what the hell makes you
 think you can beat him?!
 Your temper, maybe?
Edge: I'm not just some
 hot-headed prince, damnit!


 The Royal Family of Eblana
 has skills you can only
 DREAM about!

Rydia: Shut up!
 Just shut up, all of you![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="302">Rydia: We lost Tella,
 Yang, even Cid!
 Why? We're no closer
 than we were!
 And now...we're just
 fighting amongst ourselves!
 Do their lives mean
 nothing to us?
 Are we willing to forget
 what they fought and died
 for just so we can
 argue whose fight this is?
Edge: He..hey now...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="303">Cecil: ...Rubicante is the
 most powerful of the
 Four Emperors.

 We don't know whether or
 not we stand a chance.
 But we've got to try.

Edge: ...Okay, okay...
 Besides, I can't stand
 seeing a pretty girl cry.

 I guess I'll have to let
 you come with me...
Cain: Jeez, this guy
 never quits! Hey, Rosa.[end]</sn:pointer>

 come with us...
Edge: Where?



Queen: To Hell!



Cecil: Look out![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="307">Sylph: We never knew...



 We never knew humans have
 the capacity for kindness,
 nobility, and honor.

 Humans are filled with
 the evils of the world...
 lust, greed, hate...

 But Yang is different...
 You're his friends,
 aren't you?

 If he can call you friend,
 so can we! The Summoner

<sn:pointer id="310">Edge: Rubicante!
 You...! Why?!
 You son of a bitch!
 You'll pay!
 Oh God, you'll PAY FOR
 THIS!!!


Rubicante: Lugeie turned
 the King and Queen into
 monsters on his own.
 I deeply apologize for that.
 Believe me, I would never
 do such a thing.
 I'm different from the
 others.
 I want to fight fairly on
 equal ground.


Edge: Don't give me that
 crap! Death's too good
 for you!

Rubicante: I like brave
 people like you.


 ...But as long as humans
 become tangled up in
 emotions they will never
 attain true power...
 You are doomed to be
 forever weak.


Edge: 'Human'...is it?
 I'll show you that
 'human' thing...

 ...called anger!!![music][0xb]



Anger brought out Edge's
hidden powers!


Edge learned Suiton and
Raijin!


Rubicante: Oh...so anger
 gives humans strength...


 But not even ice can
 penetrate my cloak of flames![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="311">Rubicante: All right,
 I'll heal you!


 Fight me at full strength![end]</sn:pointer>

 How your parents must be

Chamberlain: You all?
 Oh, Young Master...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="316">Edge: Rubicante mentioned
 a Golbeze... Who is he?
Cain: The one that
 controlled Rubicante...
 He's the one gathering the
 Crystals, trying to open a
 way to the moon.

Edge: To the moon?
 What for?


Cecil: There's supposed to
 be something on the moon,
 with unimaginable power.

Rydia: We've got to stop
 Golbeze from getting it!


Edge: Rubicante a lowly
 pawn? So this is all
 because of Golbeze...

 My parents...
 because of him...


Chamberlain: Young Master,
 you have a duty to your
 subjects![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="317">Edge: The entire world's
 in danger!


 Plus, I figure Eblana's
 people would like revenge
 on Golbeze...

 Hey, since we're chasing
 that bastard..


 I just might be able to give
 him the warm greetings of
 pissed-off Ninjas...

Chamberlain: Brash as ever...
 Well, don't do something
 stupid, like getting
 yourself killed.
Edge: I get it already!
 When have I ever let
 anyone down?

Chamberlain: Do you really
 want me to answer that?
 Everyone, please take
 care of Young Master!
 Keep him under control,
 please?[end]</sn:pointer>

 Good luck!

 Another setback.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="320">Tella: I am Tella!



 I was heading to Damcyan,
 but there's a powerful

 I cannot defeat him with my

 Dark Sword.. I might be
 able to defeat him!
 !?
 Oh! This girl is a
 Summoner, isn't she?
 Quite gifted, I sense.
 The three of us might
 stand a chance...


Cecil: We also have to
 go to Damcyan!


Tella: Then it's decided!
 Let's go to Damcyan![end]</sn:pointer>

 I don't see anything
 that says 'Enemy Airship,'
 do you?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="324">Rosa: Could this be a trap?
Edge: Don't worry!
 I can smell traps a mile

 Y'know, I kinda like this

 We have lift-off, Houston![end]</sn:pointer>

 prove your worth in combat.
 Do you have the courage
 and power to challenge me?[end]</sn:pointer>

Even though you are the first
people who have defeated
Ashura, you need more than
strength to oppose evil.
You must possess a mighty

What do you say?
Will you fight with me?[end]</sn:pointer>

 Before we do any

 It's only a matter of time

 I want you to get the
 Crystal first.

 Yes...that's exactly what

[space][0x5]Thus, the Dark Knight

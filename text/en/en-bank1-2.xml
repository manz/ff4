FuSoYa: What a tragedy...


 He had such fantastic
 powers, but he was
 consumed by evil...

Edge: Yahoo!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="2">FuSoYa: Oh, you came![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="3">Rydia: We didn't make it...
Edge: SHIT!!! NO, NO, NO,
 NO, NO, NO!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="4">Rydia: Can't...can't we do
 anything?


Cecil: What's that!?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="5">Cid: As long as I'm here,
 you've got nothing to
 worry about!
 Pedal to the metal, boys!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="6">Gilbert: Cecil!
 I'll show you the courage
 that you taught me![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="7">Edge: And here I am all
 pumped up to fight
 that bastard!

 Ah, well...
 can't be breaking a sweat
 in front of the ladies.

Golbeze: Cecil...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="8">Jiott: Fire at will,
 Dwarf Tank Force!
 The underground will also
 fight for Mother Earth![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="9">Yang: I cannot rest

<sn:pointer id="10">Cecil: Everyone...!!



Rosa: The giant...
 It's confused![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="11">Edge: Oh, I see!
 An inside job![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="12">Palom: Well, that's
 basically the deal.
Porom: I'm sorry we deceived
 you. But we had no choice.
Cecil: I understand.
 Considering my past,
 that was to be expected.

Village Elder: But you've
 purged the darkness from
 your soul... and received
 the holy light!?
 It can't be..!
 That sword?!


Cecil: The Light on the
 mountain gave it to me...


Village Elder: Ages of
 prophecy, prayer, faith...
 and now...!

 Look!
 Engraved on the blade!
 It is...!!
 Mysidia's Legend!
Cecil: Legend?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="13">Edge: Like I trust you!
 What if you become evil
 again?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="14">Cain: ...If that happens,
 don't hold back...
 Kill me![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="15">Cain: ....I'm going too.
 I have a score I have to
 settle with this Zemus![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="16">Cain: Rosa...



Rosa: It's not
 Cain's fault!
 Golbeze...was under
 Zemus's control...
Cain: Golbeze?! What?![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="17">Edge: Damn straight!



 It's your own damned fault
 that the Giant showed up in
 the first place![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="18">Cain: Save the talk

<sn:pointer id="21">FuSoYa: This is the
 Giant's Heart,

Edge: Damn, it's HUGE!
FuSoYa: Before we attack the
 Control System we've got to
 destroy the Defense System,
 or else it'll repair itself![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="22">Cecil: We did it!
Edge: It stopped![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="23">Golbeze: You've stopped
 the Giant!
 You will all PAY for this
 with your lives!
FuSoYa: You!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="24">Golbeze: Who...!?
 Who the hell are you!?
FuSoYa: You! Don't you
 even know who you are!?
Golbeze: No, stop!!
FuSoYa: Open your eyes![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="25">Golbeze: ...No...what
 have I done?...Oh,
 God...what have I done?

 ...I was filled with so
 much hatred...


FuSoYa: ....You've
 regained your senses.
 ...Your father...Tell me
 your father's name!
Golbeze: My father....
 KluYa...


Cecil: WHAT!?



Rosa: All this time...
 Cecil's...
Edge: Brother!?

Cecil: Golbeze's my...



FuSoYa: You were controlled
 by Zemus...


 Those of Lunar blood are
 susceptible to psychic
 power, thus easier to
 control...
 You were his unwitting
 pawn...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="26">Edge: What the hell?!



Cecil: I was...
 fighting my own brother...


 ...



Golbeze: You're my....



Cecil: But it could have
 been the other way around...
 I could have been used for
 evil...
 I was a Dark Knight...



Golbeze: ...But our souls
 were tested...
 You renounced evil, so I
 was found wanting...
 Zemus!!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="27">Cecil: Where are you going!?



Golbeze: I'm going to end
 this myself![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="28">FuSoYa: Wait![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="29">FuSoYa: Zemus is also
 of our race!
 I'll come with you...!![end]</sn:pointer>

 He'll get himself killed!

Cecil: ...



Rydia: He's your brother,
 right?


Cecil: ...Brother...
 


Rydia: Go after him!



Cecil: ....[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="32">Edge: Holy shit!
 This is not good!
Rydia: We've got to get
 out of here!
Rosa: Cecil!
Cecil: .....[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="33">Edge: What the hell
 are you doing!?
Rydia: How do we get
 out of here!?
'This way!'[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="34">Rosa: Cain!
Edge: We won't fall for
 that![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="35">Cain: I finally regained
 control of myself.
 My mind was held captive by
 my evil actions...
 I can't ask you to forgive
 me, but...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="36">Rosa: Stop it![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="37">Rosa: Golbeze is
 Cecil's brother...
Cecil: ....

Rosa: Golbeze and
 Cecil have blood of the
 Lunarians, an advanced race
 hibernating on the moon.
 One Lunarian, Zemus, wanted
 to enslave the earth, so he
 used Golbeze to gather the
 Crystals.
 However, another Lunarian
 named FuSoYa removed the
 spell on Golbeze...

Rydia: And then Golbeze went
 to the moon with FuSoYa to
 defeat Zemus.

Cain: Golbeze's....
 Cecil's brother..?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="38">Edge: Oh, believe me,
 I will. Between you and
 Zemus, at least I'm
 guaranteed some action!
 Besides, I'm not just going
 to sit back and let Zemus
 play with the lives of
 people like that!
Cain: Edge...
Cecil: Let's go...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="39">Cecil: ...I'm going too...



Rosa: Cecil...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="40">Edge: Now Rydia,
 this is where you get off.


 Leave the bad guys to us.
 You just stay here and
 be a good little girl!

Rydia: ...You'd better be
 kidding, because I'd hate to
 be you if you weren't.

 Let me tell you what I'd do
 to some pig who talked to me
 like that.

 I'd end his reproductive
 years rather quickly.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="41">Cecil: Let's go!
 Cain! Edge![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="42">Edge: Rydia...
 That was kinda below the
 belt. I don't blame you for
 being a bitch to me...
 God, I'll miss you.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="43">Cecil: Let's go![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="44">Rosa: ....



Cecil: Get out of my way...



Rosa: No!



 Unless you take me with you,
 I'm not moving an inch.


Cecil: What!! Rosa!
 It's dangerous out there!


Rosa: As long as I'm near
 you, whatever happens...
[music][0x13]

 ...no, as long as I'm with
 you I don't care how
 dangerous things are!

Cecil: Rosa...



Cain: ...Come on, Cecil...



Edge: Yeah, let her come!
 At least you've got a woman.
 I have two chances with
 Rydia, slim and none...
Cecil: All right, Rosa...
 I'll...


 I'll protect you![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="45">Edge: Rydia!! You're here!



Rydia: As I said before,
 this is everybody's fight,
 not just yours.

 Plus I'm the only
 Summoner you have!


Cecil: Rydia...
 All right...
 Let's go! We'll
 fight...for everyone![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="46">Cecil: Rosa and Rydia,
 you stay here.
 The three of us will go
 by ourselves.
 This time there's no
 guarantee that we'll
 come back alive...

Rosa: Cecil!
Rydia: Are you joking!?


Cecil: Come on, get
 off the Magical Ship![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="47">It worked![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="55">FuSoYa: Incredible![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="56">FuSoYa: To think that you all
 had that much power!


 The Blue Planet has evolved
 so much while we've been
 asleep!

Edge: Ha! To hear Rydia
 talk, I should be the
 missing link![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="57">Village Elder: You!
 You're that Dark Knight!
 What have you come to
 destroy this time?
Cecil: My name is Cecil,
 and I was the head of
 Baron's airship force.

 I came here before as a
 coward...I couldn't bring
 myself to disobey the
 King's orders.
 Now I come seeking
 forgiveness.


Village Elder: Even if you
 apologize, it won't bring
 back the people you
 murdered.
Cecil: ....



Village Elder: However...
 I sense a faint glimmer of
 light within you that was
 not there before.
 It might be worth listening
 to what you have to say.


Cecil: I'm fighting Golbeze,
 the man who is controlling
 Baron.

 When my friends and I tried
 to prevent the theft of the
 Wind Crystal, he kidnapped
 one of us.
 We were going to save her,
 but Leviathan attacked us,
 and now...

Village Elder: ...You lost
 your friends...


 It seems Fate has chosen
 you to endure this trial.
 And Fate brought you back
 here.
 You seek to destroy a great
 darkness, but as long as you
 rely on the Dark Sword, you
 cannot defeat true evil.
 Your soul is stained
 with the darkness of
 your deeds...

 Evil is like a cancer. It
 spreads, consuming the soul
 entirely. You could become
 as evil as the man you seek.
 If you wish for your faint
 glimmer to become a radiant
 light, then go to Mt. Ordeals in the east.
Cecil: But I must save
 my friend!


Village Elder: If you truly
 cherish this friend, you
 will endure this trial,

 and be bathed in the
 purifying light of
 redemption at the summit.

 You must renounce your Dark
 Sword and receive the power
 of a Holy Knight...

 a Paladin!



 Be warned, though.
 Many have sought to
 become a Paladin.

Cecil: They tried and
 failed?
Village Elder: Oh, no.
 They tried and died...
 But you seem to carry a
 great destiny...
 What do you say, will you go? 
Cecil: ...Yes!



Village Elder: But your Dark
 Sword will have little
 effect on the monsters of
 the mountain.
 I'll send Magicians
 with you.


 Palom! Porom![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="58">Welcome![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="59">Cecil: Who are you...?



Old Man: I am FuSoYa,
 guardian of the
 sleeping People of the
 Moon, the Lunarians.
Rosa: Lunarians?



FuSoYa: Correct.
 It's been a very long
 time...

 We are people from a long-
 destroyed planet that was
 between the fourth and fifth
 planet of the solar system.
 During the final days of
 our world, we built a ship
 and traveled to the
 Blue Planet...
 The journey was long...
 We had to hibernate
 for survival.

Cecil: The Blue Planet...?
FuSoYa: The planet that you
 live on.

 But the creatures of your
 planet were still evolving,
 so we created another moon
 and continued sleeping...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="60">Edge: Another moon?



FuSoYa: But one of us
 refused to sleep...


 He wanted to purge your
 planet of all living beings
 so we could settle there.

Rydia: How awful...!



FuSoYa: ....He was a
 brilliant man, but
 impatient.

 We tried to reason with
 him, but he wouldn't listen.
 Instead, he became
 bitter and vengeful...
 He created the Tower of
 Babil to give mankind the
 tool to destroy themselves.

 It was then I forced that
 man to sleep, but his mind
 was still awake.

 Over these eons, he became
 consumed with hatred,


 increasing his psychic
 powers to destroy every
 living thing...

 Since he is sealed below,
 he uses his powers to
 control those with a
 dark soul...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="61">Cecil: Then Golbeze is
 merely a puppet?!


Edge: Who is this guy!?



FuSoYa: His name is Zemus...!
 The Crystals are our
 source of energy.

 Zemus, knowing this, used the Crystals' power to operate
 the Dimensional Elevator in
 the Tower of Babil.
 Once all the crystals
 are gathered, the
 elevator brings down
 mankind's doom...
 the Giant of Babil!



Rosa: The 'way to the
 Moon'...is that...?
 

FuSoYa: But the rest of
 us aren't like that...


 We wanted to wait until the
 people of the Blue Planet
 were advanced enough to be
 able to speak with us,
 to share our hopes, fears,
 experiences, and fates...


 Together, our combined people could have done so much...
 We...dreamed of that day...

Cecil: What about the
 Magical Ship that brought
 us here?

FuSoYa: It wasn't too long
 ago that my younger brother,
 KluYa, made it and went to
 the Blue Planet.
 KluYa was enthralled with
 your world and often spoke
 about aiding your
 evolution...
 He built the Devil Road,
 and gave your people the
 technology to build airships. 
 He founded Mysidia and taught them legends that would make
 our dream a reality.

 However, KluYa fell in love
 with a woman from the Blue
 Planet.
 She bore him two children.
 One of them was...



 ...you, Cecil.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="62">Apprentices: Yes sir![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="63">Cecil: !!



 Me...?



 Then the voice I heard
 on Mt. Ordeals was...


FuSoYa: Your father...
 It was KluYa's spirit...


 I see now...you look so
 much like KluYa...
 when he was young...

Cecil: That voice was...
 my father...!


FuSoYa: KluYa gave you his
 power to combat Zemus...
 We must stop him!

 For the people of the Moon
 and of the Blue Planet!
 Hurry to the Tower of Babil!

Edge: The Tower of Babil!?
 But it's surrounded by a
 barrier![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="64">FuSoYa: I have powers that
 can neutralize the barrier!


 We cannot let the Giant of
 Babil be unleashed upon the
 Blue Planet!
 I shall go with you!
[space][0x8]Lunarian FuSoYa
[space][0x7]joined the party![music][0x29][delay][0x28][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="65">Cain: But about those final
 words that Zeromus left...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="66">Rosa: As long as evil
 hearts still exist...


FuSoYa: Everyone holds both
 good and evil in his soul...
 just like there are Crystals
 of Light and Darkness...
 Evil will never disappear...
 but as long as humans
 continue to band together...

 cherishing the ideals of
 virtue, trust, and honor,
 it will never triumph.

Edge: Preach on, brother!



 I make it my personal
 responsibility to be a
 bastion of virtue![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="67">Rydia: 'Bastion of virtue!'
 What the hell are you
 talking about!?

 It's almost a miracle that
 someone like you didn't get
 possessed by Zemus![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="68">
 Sage Tella joined the party![delay][0x28][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="69">Wait!![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="70">Edge: This pretty
 face, evil?
 That'd be a crying shame!

FuSoYa: At least the Blue
 Planet will be lively with
 you two around...

 Now, I must return to
 my sleep.
 What will you do?[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="71">Cecil: We're going to return
 to our world.
Rosa: Everyone's waiting
 for us![end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="72">FuSoYa: I see.
 You have wonderful friends.


 I will look forward to
 meeting with your people
 again.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="73">Golbeze: May I...
 May I go with you?
FuSoYa: You?

Golbeze: Yes...
 I...can't go back.
 Not after what I've done.

 And I'd also like to meet
 my father's people.


FuSoYa: I see...You also have
 Lunarian blood flowing in
 your veins...
 But it will be a long sleep.
Golbeze: I know.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="74">Golbeze: Brother...



Cecil: ....



Golbeze: ....I see...I'm not
 worthy to be called your
 brother....

 I've caused you...
 so much pain...Back then...


 I was arrogant...
 merciless...unforgiving...


 Now I stand before you a
 broken...defeated...
 repentant man.

 Maybe...I can comfort the
 aching of my soul in sleep...[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="75">FuSoYa: We must go now...
 I pray for peace on the
 Blue Planet.[end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="76">Rosa: Cecil...
Cain: Cecil, forgive
 him as you did me...

Rydia: He's your brother![end]</sn:pointer>

 Teleportation.'[delay][0x20]
 Have you been practicing

Porom: Yes, sir.

Village Elder: What about
 your Dejon spell, Palom...?
 Palom?
Porom: Not again!![delay][0x1c][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="81">Palom: And then, I single-
 handedly killed the teeming
 hordes of undead on Mt.
 Ordeals. As you can imagine,[delay][0x20]
 I was tired, but no rest for
 the weary... Cecil needed
 me to cast my powerful
 Blizzard spell...[delay][0x20]
 He said I was far more heroic than him... Ah, I can see by
 the blank stare in your eyes, you think so too...[delay][0x1d]
 Whaddya say we find a quieter place where I can show you
 something, ahem...
 equally impressive...?[delay][0x20][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="82">Palom: Ow-ow-ow!
Porom: You perverted
 little boy!
Palom: I was just going to[delay][0x18]

Porom: Yeah, I bet...
 Our Elder's really mad at
 you! Come on![delay][0x1d][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="83">Village Elder: How many times
 do I have to tell you not to
 skip lessons? What do I have
 to do to get through to a[delay][0x20]

 Maybe scribing spells will

 of lessons![delay][0x20][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

 That'll take forever![delay][0xc][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="85">Porom: You brought it
 upon yourself![delay][0xc][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="86">Chamberlain: ...And
 furthermore, you lack
 the discipline to be
 an effective ruler...[delay][0x19][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="87">Edge: Enough already!
 I ask you for a few
 suggestions on
 self-improvement...[delay][0x19]

 full-blown dissertation![delay][0x10][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="88">Chamberlain: I haven't even
 started. Next, your female
 companions leave something
 to be desired...[delay][0x20]
Edge: What's wrong with
 women?
 I happen to like women!
[delay][0x18]
Chamberlain: That's not what I meant. You 'accidentally'
 bump into every pretty girl
 you see, and go into[delay][0x20]
 convulsions when one bends
 over to pick something up.
Edge: Okay, okay!
 I'll settle down![delay][0x1d]

<sn:pointer id="92">Monster Child: Hey, Rydia.
 How come I've got fangs

 I wish I was like you.[delay][0x20][0x6][end]</sn:pointer>

<sn:pointer id="93">Rydia: What are you

 Humans and Phantom Beasts
 both have the ability[delay][0x20]

 Don't you want to rebuild

 no more monsters!'

[delay][0x12]
Gilbert: That's what the

 rid of those scary monsters.
[delay][0x18]
 But there are some things
 worse than monsters. We don't want our mommies and daddies

 That's why we've got to

 I'm gonna help you

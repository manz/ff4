Tella: Anna, you're still alive...<new>
Anna: Father...he...
Gilbert is the Prince of Damcyan...<new>
In order to hide his identity, he came to Kaipo as a bard...<new>
Forgive me for running away, father... I...love...Gilbert!<new>
Gilbert: Golbeze is controlling the Red Wings...
Cecil: Who is Golbeze?<new>
Gilbert: I don't know...
He was cloaked completely in black... unbelievably powerful.<new>
Cecil: Why did the Red Wings bomb the castle?<new>
Gilbert: They pillaged the castle in order to steal the Crystal...<new>
My mother...father...dead... and Anna shielded me... from...arrows...<new>

Soldat: On dirait que le capitaine est anxieux, vous ne trouvez pas&?<new>
Soldat: Quand on sait ce que nous avons fait, qui ne le serait pas ?<new>
Je sais que les ordres sont les ordres, mais tuer des innocents pour obtenir des Cristaux...<new>
C'est insensÈ!

Soldat: Capitaine! Pourquoi sommes nous allÈs si loin?<new>
Surtout pour piller un village de magiciens qui ne se sont mÍme pas dÈfendus!<new>
Cecil: Bon, Ècoutez- moi attentivement! Il Ètait impÈratif d'attaquer Mysidia. Sa MajestÈ a dÈcrÈtÈ qu'il Ètait vital de possÈder les Cristaux.<new>
Le peuple de Mysidia en savait trop ‡ ce sujet. Il fallait faire taire cette menace.<new>
La continuitÈ de la souverainetÈ de notre royaume est ‡ ce prix. Et Baron a besoin des Cristaux pour cela.<new>
Nous sommes les Ailes Rouge, la force aÈrienne de Baron.<new>
Nous devons accomplir notre mission, quelle qu'en soit la maniËre. On ne peut dÈsobÈÔr aux ordres de Sa MajestÈ...<new>
Soldat: Capitaine...

Cecil: Les Mysidiens&... Il se sont a peine dÈfendus&...<new>
Beigan: Que dites vous&? ...Suivez moi, sa MajestÈe attends.
<end>

<PT0040>
...
<end>

<PT0041>
Beigan: Sir Cecil, please wait here a moment.
<end>

<PT0042>
Beigan: Your Majesty... It seems Cecil has developed a distrust of the Throne...<new>
King Baron: Truly?
Well done, Captain of the Guards!<new>
Thank you for letting me know! But all that matters is the crystal ... Call in Cecil.<new>
Beigan: Yes, my liege.
<end>

<PT0043>
Beigan: Sir Cecil, His Majesty awaits. Please enter.
<end>

<PT0044>
King Baron: Well done, Cecil. So, where is the crystal?<new>
Cecil: My lord, I have it.
<end>

<PT0045>
You gave the King the Water Crystal.
<end>

<PT0046>
Beigan: Hmm...It appears to be genuine.<new>
King Baron: It is! Oh, how it glimmers... like light shining on the depths of the sea...<new>
You may leave, Cecil!
<end>

<PT0047>
Cecil: ...
<end>

<PT0048>
Cecil: Your Majesty!
<end>

<PT0049>
King Baron: Wh..what!?
Beigan: Wh, what is it?
<end>

<PT0050>
Cecil: Your Majesty, we do not understand your motives. Why is it you need the crystals?<new>
Was it because the Mysidians were becoming a threat? Then why didn't they resist?<new>
We do not understand why innocent bystanders had to die.<new>
Some have even wondered if your actions are... altogether... honorable.<new>
King Baron: So you distrust your own King, Cecil?!<new>
Cecil: !! No, I didn't mean that at all!!<new>
King Baron: Did you think that I knew nothing about your true feelings!?<new>
To think that I took you in and raised you like a son! Now, you can't even trust me.<new>
I can no longer entrust you with the command of the Red Wings.<new>
As of now, you are relieved of your post!
<end>

<PT0051>
King Baron: Your new charge is to eliminate the Phantom Beasts that haunt the upper valley!
<end>

<PT0052>
Cain: Please wait!
<end>

<PT0053>
Cain: Cecil wasn't...
<end>

<PT0054>
King Baron: Cain, if you're so worried about Cecil, then go with him!<new>
Cecil: But your Majesty!<new>
King Baron: I have nothing more to say! Here! Take this ring and go!
<end>

<PT0055>
Cecil: Sorry for getting you mixed up in all of this, Cain.<new>
Cain: Once you defeat those Phantom Beasts, His Majesty will surely forgive you,<new>
and you will be reinstated as Commander of the Red Wings.<new>
Cecil: ...
Cain: You've had a long day.<new>
Leave all the preparations to me, and go get some rest.
<end>

<PT0056>
Cain: What's wrong?
Cecil: I'm sorry, Cain...<new>
Cain: Why are you still apologizing? I defended you out of my own free will!<new
Cecil: It's not that, Cain. It was my mission today...<new>
I learned the art of the Dark Sword as ordered by His Majesty.<new>
But it should have been to defend Baron, and not to harm innocent people.<new>
Maybe apologizing will help clear my conscience...<new>
Cain: Don't be so hard on yourself. I'm sure the king has a good reason for his actions.<new>
He raised us as his own sons. He would never do anything less than honorable.<new>
Cecil: Cain, I envy your faith in His Majesty.<new>
He spoke of your father... He had the same unwavering loyalty...<new>
Cain: My father... My father was a Dragon Knight as well...<new>
If I had mastered the art of the Dark Sword as the King had commanded, I probably would have advanced up the ranks like you...<new>
However, I felt it was my duty to honor my father and follow in his path.<new>
He died while I was still a child...Sometimes I wish he could see me today. I hope he would be proud.<new>
I often have these moments... moments of quiet reflection when I can feel his spirit within me, guiding me...<new>
Cecil: ...
Cain: Sorry to have rambled on like that... That's not like me.<new>
Anyhow, I wouldn't worry too much about today. You really should be worrying about tomorrow!<new>
You did what the King wanted and became a Dark Knight...<new>
You have rank and prestige over me, but tomorrow we'll see who's better... <new>
We must get an early start tomorrow. Go get some rest.
<end>

<PT0057>
Rosa: Cecil!
<end>

<PT0058>
Rosa: Thank God you're all right!
Your mission was so sudden, I was worried.<new>
Cecil: We were all right...
We couldn't get hurt by a bunch of Magicians who didn't even resist...
<end>

<PT0059>
Rosa: I'm coming to your room again tonight...<new>
Cecil: ...
<end>

<PT0060>
Cecil: Why is His Majesty behaving this way?<new>
As a Knight he was known for his kindness and valor.<new>
Cain and I were orphans, but he took us in and raised us like his own sons.<new>
But now...
Mysidia's Crystal...<new>
Is it something so necessary that we must take it by force from innocent villagers?<new>
To think that we would do such a thing, even under orders!!
<end>

<PT0061>
Rosa: What happened?<new>
One second you're being sent to Mysidia, the next you're being sent off to kill some ghastly monsters.<new>
And you've been acting strange since you came back.<new>
Cecil: No, it's nothing...
<end>

<PT0062>
Rosa: Then please don't look away...
<end>

<PT0063>
Cecil: In Mysidia...<new>
I killed innocent people, plundered their village, and stole their crystal, all for what?!<new>
Why did I do such a thing?
It's as if my heart has become as dark as my armor!
<end>

<PT0064>
Rosa: ...You're not like that.
<end>

<PT0065>
Cecil: I'm just a spineless Dark Knight, just a pawn of the King...
<end>

<PT0066>
Rosa: The Cecil of the Red Wings I know would never whimper like that!<new>
Not the Cecil I love...
<end>

<PT0067>
Rosa: You're going to Mist tomorrow, right?<new>
If anything happens to you, I...
<end>

<PT0068>
Cecil: ...Cain is coming
 with me...
<end>

<PT0069>
Cecil: It's late now...
 Get some rest.
<end>

<PT0070>
Rosa: Be careful!
 For my sake...
<end>

<PT0071>
Cecil: Thanks, Rosa...
 But I'm only a Dark Knight...

 What can I do?
<end>

<PT0072>
Cecil: Yang! You're alive!
Yang: You!


Cecil: You don't
 recognize me?
 It's me, Cecil!
 I became a Paladin...
Yang: Cecil!
 I've been looking for you!


 Traitor to the King! Attack!
Soldiers: Yes sir!
<end>

<PT0073>
Cecil: Yang,
 don't you recognize me?
Yang: I recognize you,
 you fugitive!
<end>

<PT0074>
Yang: Sir Cecil!
 What have I done?
 I was knocked out by
 Leviathan...then...
Tella: Baron controlled
 you while you were amnesiac.
Yang: B...Baron?
 I've disgraced myself...
<end>

<PT0075>
Yang: Rydia was
 swallowed by Leviathan.
 Gilbert...I don't know.
Cecil: Oh...
<end>

<PT0076>
Yang: Where are we?



Cecil: We're in Baron.
 If the soldiers overhear
 us, we're in trouble.

 There's a quiet room in
 the inn where we can talk.



  Yang has joined the party!<music><29><delay><28>
<end>

<PT0077>
Yang: And who is this?
Cecil: He's Tella,
 the Sage. Gilbert's...

Tella: My daughter
 sacrificed her life to
 protect...him.
Yang: ...
 I am Yang, captain
 of the Monks at Fabul.
<end>

<PT0078>
Porom: Palom!
Yang: ...
Cecil: Anyhow,
 we've got to save Cid...
Tella: But it won't be so
 easy to get in the castle...
<end>

<PT0079>
Cecil: This is the
 key to Baron!


 Yang, they must have given
 it to you when you became
 the leader of the guards!

 With this we might be
 able to do something!


You received the key to Baron!<music><29><delay><28>
<end>

<PT0080>
The ring is glowing..!?
<end>

<PT0081>
Cain: What is this!?
Cecil: This is why we
 were sent here...!

Cain: To burn the
 village...!?
<end>

<PT0082>
Cecil: WHY!?
 King Baron!! NO!!


'Mom! NO..!!' -weep-
<end>

<PT0083>
Cecil: Who's that?
<end>

<PT0084>
Girl: Mom's dragon died,
 so Mom did too...
 -sniff-, -sniff-
<end>

<PT0085>
Cecil: Dear God!
Cain: Come to think of it,
 I've heard of this.

 People with the power
 to call monsters...
 They are called Summoners!

Cecil: No!! It can't
 be that us defeating
 that dragon caused this
 girl's mother to die..?
<end>

<PT0086>
Girl: You guys killed Mom's
 dragon?!
Cecil: We didn't know...
<end>

<PT0087>
Cain: The King sent us here
 to wipe out the Summoners...
Cecil: Dear God...

Cain: Unfortunately,
 our orders...we have no
 alternative but to
 kill this girl as well.
<end>

<PT0088>
Cecil: Cain!
Cain: If we disobey the
 King, we'll be executed
 for treason!
Cecil: But she's just a
 child!
Cain: ...Are you saying
 we should defy the King?
Cecil: If he expects
 us to murder like this...
 I have no intention of
 following him!
 I renounce all loyalty to
 the King, to the Red Wings,
 and to Baron!!!
<end>

<PT0089>
Cain: Hmm, I thought you'd
 say that. I won't let you
 oppose the King alone,
 of course.
Cecil: Cain?



Cain: No matter how much I
 owe the King, as a Dragon
 Knight I could never
 perform such a lowly deed.
Cecil: Then you didn't
 really intend to...


Cain: Baron is the
 strongest military power
 in the world.

 Just the two of us
 opposing it would mean
 nothing against their might.

 We must let the other
 countries know about Baron's
 lust for power and enlist
 their aid!
 And we must save Rosa!



Cecil: Thanks, Cain.
Cain: I'm not doing
 this particularly for
 you though, you know.
<end>

<PT0090>
Cain: Anyway, it's too
 dangerous for us to stay
 here.

 We've got to get out
 of this village. What
 should we do with the
 girl?
Cecil: Only one choice!
 She goes with us!
<end>

<PT0091>
Cecil: Come on, it's
 dangerous here.
 Come with us.

Girl: No!
<end>

<PT0092>
Cain: We've got no choice!
 We'll have to force her
 to come with us!

Girl: Don't come any closer!
<end>

<PT0093>
Cecil: Wait!
<end>

<PT0094>
Girl: I can't stand it!
 I hate you!
 I hate you all!
<end>

<PT0095>
Cecil: Phew,
 the girl's all right...


 !!Cain!



 !!Cain!
 Where are you?


 !!
<end>

<PT0096>
Cecil: I can't stay here
 forever...I've got to get
 out of here...
 Cain...Please be alive!
<end>

<PT0097>
Cecil: If she doesn't
 get some rest...
<end>

<PT0098>
Welcome!
Oh no, she looks ill!
Quickly, quickly,
go into the room!
Don't worry about money,
please!


Cecil: Thanks.
<end>

<PT0099>
Cecil: You've come to...
Girl: ....


Cecil: You haven't
 told me your name yet.
Girl: ....

Cecil: ...I can't ask
 you to forgive me for
 killing your mother.

 But please let me
 protect you...


Girl: ....
<end>

<PT0100>
General: We've found you,
 Cecil!!
Girl: !!

Cecil: Wait! The King
 of Baron is...


General: King's orders.
 If you turn over the
 survivor from Mist, he will
 forgive your treachery.
 It has been deemed
 dangerous for the people
 of Mist to even exist!

Cecil: What!?
 Has the King stooped so
 low as to kill children?!
Girl: !!
General: Shut up with the
 lecture and give me the girl!

Cecil: I refuse!
<end>

<PT0101>
Girl: I'm sorry, this is
 my fault...


Cecil: I should be the
 one apologizing.
 What I did should not
 be forgotten.
Girl: But...
 you protected me...
Cecil: ...
<end>

<PT0102>
Girl: I'm...Rydia...



Cecil: Thanks...
 Rydia.



<space><04>Summoner Rydia joined!
<end>

<PT0103>
You shined the
Light of the Desert on Rosa!
<end>

<PT0104>
Rosa: Ooh...
<end>

<PT0105>
Rosa: Cecil! You're here!
 I'm so glad...


Cecil: Why did you
 come here?


Rosa: I heard you died in
 the earthquake at Mist...
 But I didn't believe it...

Cecil: Don't worry...
 I'm here...
 Rosa, who is Golbeze?

Rosa: The King of Baron
 called him to take your
 place as the commander of
 the Red Wings.
 Ever since he came,
 King Baron has given
 more and more authority
 to him...
 Golbeze is certainly
 the one influencing
 the King to gather the
 four Crystals.
 The Water Crystal from
 Mysidia...


 The Fire Crystal from
 Damcyan...


 The Wind Crystal from
 Fabul...


 and the Earth Crystal
 from Toroia.
<end>

<PT0106>
Gilbert: He's taken the
 Fire Crystal...


Cecil: This is Gilbert,
 the prince of Damcyan.
 It's because of him that
 we were able to heal you.
 This girl is Rydia,
 from Mist.


Rydia: Are you OK?
Rosa: I'm better...
 thanks...

 If Damcyan's crystal has
 already been taken
 then Fabul is next!

 We can't let this happen...
 -cough, cough-
<end>

<PT0107>
Cecil: Rosa, don't
 overdo it.
 We'll go to Fabul.

Gilbert: But the way to Fabul
 over Hobs Mountain is frozen
 over...
<end>

<PT0108>
Rosa: ...Rydia,
 can you cast Fire?
Rydia: !

 ...Hmm...no I can't...
<end>

<PT0109>
Rosa: If you're a Summoner,
 you should be able to cast a
 basic Black Magic spell like
 Fire...-cough-
<end>

<PT0110>
Cecil: Rosa! You must rest!
<end>

<PT0111>
Gilbert: Anna...why did
 you have to leave me..?
<end>

<PT0112>
Gilbert: Anna!



Anna: Gilbert, I must
 leave...My time has come...
 to become one with an
 eternal spirit...
Gilbert: Anna!
 Please don't go!
<end>

<PT0113>
Anna: Gilbert, be brave!
 You must not let Golbeze
 gather the Crystals...

 You loved me.
 Now give that love to the
 people of this earth.
<end>

<PT0114>
Gilbert: Anna,
 I'll fight. But courage...
 Anna, what should I do...?
<end>

<PT0115>
Tella: Fast asleep
 already...
 Must have been an exhausting
 day for one so young...
 Is this girl...



Cecil: She's a Summoner
 from Mist.


Tella: I sense great
 potential within her.
 She could become quite
 a gifted sorceress...
 ...
 Such a peaceful face...
 So much like Anna when
 she was a child.
Cecil: Anna is...



Tella: My only daughter.
 She eloped to Damcyan with a
 bard because I wouldn't
 consent to their marriage...
<end>

<PT0116>
Tella: Why are you
 going there?


Cecil: A friend of mine in
 Kaipo has an extremely
 high fever.

Tella: So you're after
 the Light of the Desert...
 Without that, there's
 not much hope...
Cecil: What is the
 monster in this cavern?
Tella: It's a huge creature
 with eight legs.
 In order to save Anna and
 your friend we've got to
 beat it first...

 I hope this horrible feeling
 I have about Damcyan is just
 my imagination, but...
<end>

<PT0117>
Cid: What're y'all
 worrying about?
 I'll be back soon!

 Just sit tight and wait
 like good little children!
<end>

<PT0118>
Rosa: Be careful...
Cid: Ho ho, Rosa!
 Don't be falling for me now!
<end>

<PT0119>
Cecil: King Jiott.
 Where is the crystal
 in this castle?

Jiott: It's hidden in a
 secret room behind this
 very throne!

 I can just sit here
 and watch.
 Everything will be safe!
<end>

<PT0120>
Yang: !
<end>

<PT0121>
Cecil: What's wrong, Yang?
Yang: Someone's there!
Jiott: Who!?
<end>

<PT0122>
Jiott: Open the door!
Dwarf: Lali!
<end>

<PT0123>
The...Red...Wings...

<PT0124>
King Fabul: Yang,
 you're back!
 The look on your face...

Yang: King Fabul, the man
 known as Golbeze is
 mobilizing the forces of
 Baron to take our crystal!
King Fabul: What!?
 Can this be so?
Yang: These people
 came to let us know.
King Fabul: Who are they?
<end>

<PT0125>
Cecil: There's not much
 time.
 We must fortify the castle!

King Fabul: Wait a minute!
 You're a Dark Knight
 from Baron!
 Can I trust you?
Yang: Your Highness!
 They saved me from
 Golbeze's minions on the
 mountain!
Cecil: Time is of the
 essence!
 We must prepare for battle!
Rosa: Please hurry!
<end>

<PT0126>
Gilbert: It's been quite
 a while, King Fabul.
King Fabul: Prince Gilbert!

Gilbert: Damcyan has
 already been attacked
 and our crystal stolen!

 I lost...
 everyone dear to me...
 everything that mattered...

 Don't let Fabul suffer
 the same fate.
<end>

<PT0127>
Yang: Well then, Sir Cecil!
<end>

<PT0128>
Yang: These people are
 extremely skilled in the
 fighting arts.

 Please allow them to fight
 with me on the front lines!


King Fabul: If you are
 this insistent,
 I shall leave this matter
 in your hands, Yang!
 Ladies, since you possess
 the white magic skill, would
 you provide medical aid?

Rosa: Very well.
King Fabul: Yang,
 I'm counting on you!

Yang: I will guard my
 country with my life!
<end>

<PT0129>
Rosa: Take care, Cecil...
Cecil: You too...
 Rydia!
 Take care of Rosa!
<end>

<PT0130>
'Here they come!'



Yang: Move out to meet them!
<end>

<PT0131>
'It's the Red Wings!'
<end>

<PT0132>
Cecil: We're just going to
 get killed like this!
Yang: Inside the castle!
 Hurry!!
<end>

<PT0133>
Yang: I'm sorry, bringing
 you into a hopeless battle!


Cecil: As I said before,
 this is our fight as well!
 And we haven't lost yet!
Gilbert: H..here they come!
<end>

<PT0134>
Yang: Damn! Pull back!
<end>

<PT0135>
Cecil: Isn't the throne room
 back here!?


Yang: Don't worry!
 The King has evacuated with
 the people to a safe area!

 We have to worry about these
 monsters!
<end>

<PT0136>
Yang: Kill 'em all!
<end>

<PT0137>
Gilbert: It's hopeless here!
Yang: Damnit!
<end>

<PT0138>
Yang: The door is locked!
 We've got to hold them here!


Cecil: Where's the crystal?!
Yang: In the room beyond here!
<end>

<PT0139>
Yang: What the hell are you
 doing?!
Gilbert: He..he's not human!
<end>

<PT0140>
Yang: We're trapped!
 Retreat to the Crystal room!
<end>

<PT0141>
Cain: It's been a while...



Cecil: Cain! You're alive!
<end>

<PT0142>
Cecil: You're...under
 Golbeze's control!? Why?!


Cain: Wake up...
 Time to die...
Yang: You'll have to come
 through me first!

<PT0143>
'NO!! STOP!'
<end>

<PT0144>
Cain: ...Rosa..?
Rosa: Cain, no!!


Cain: Urg..agh..!
 Don't..look...at...me!
<end>

<PT0145>
What's troubling you, Cain?
<end>

<PT0146>
Gilbert: Golbeze!
Cecil: You're Golbeze...!


Golbeze: So you're Cecil...
 Perfect setting for
 introductions,
 don't you think?
 Well, perfect for me, at
 least. You're sprawled on
 the ground and I'm about
 to take the crystal.
Gilbert: Cecil!
Yang: Over my dead body!
<end>

<PT0147>
Golbeze: That's the whole
 idea.
<end>

<PT0148>
Golbeze: Cain...
 Stop standing around
 and get the Crystal.
Cain: Yes, Master!
<end>

<PT0149>
Rosa: Stop, Cain!
Cain: !
Cecil: Stay away, Rosa!!

Golbeze: I get it...
 This girl is dear to you.
 So I'll take her.

 It's been a pleasure
 defeating you. We must
 do it again sometime.

 And since I have this girl,
 there'll be a next time...


 Let's go, Cain!
<end>

<PT0150>
Cain: Looks like you
 get to live a bit longer,
 Cecil!
<end>

<PT0151>
Cecil: Wa..it!
<end>

<PT0152>
Cecil: Agh...
<end>

<PT0153>
Rydia: Cure!
<end>

<PT0154>
Rydia: Are you all right?
Gilbert: ...
 Rosa... kidnapped.

Yang: ...We couldn't
 protect the crystal...
 I...failed...

Cecil: Rosa...
<end>

<PT0155>
Rydia: Hey! Don't give up
 so easily!
 Rosa's gonna be all right...

 And we can get back
 the Crystal!
<end>

<PT0156>
Gilbert: ...That's right!
<end>

<PT0157>
Sir Yang, you must be
tired. Please rest.
<end>

<PT0158>
Gilbert: Rosa... In order
 to fight Golbeze, we're
 going to need an airship.
 But only Baron has them...
Yang: I wonder if there's
 any way to sneak into
 Baron...
<end>

<PT0159>
Cecil: As Baron's
 military strength lies in
 the Red Wings, their navy
 is comparatively weak.
 If we're going to sneak in
 we'll have to do it by sea.
Rydia: Then we're
 going to need a ship.
Yang: Let's ask the King
 first thing tomorrow
 morning.

 You came to his aid in
 a time of need.
 The King will most
 certainly grant you one.
Cecil: Please...
<end>

<PT0160>
Yang: Who was that
 Dragon Knight?


Cecil: He's Cain, and he
 is...was...my rival and...
 best friend.

 We vowed to escape Baron
 together...
Yang: Really...

Gilbert: In any case,
 let's rest easy tonight.
Cecil: ...
<end>

<PT0161>
Yang's wife: Dear!
 Be sure to show those
 bastards how much we
 like invasions!
Yang: Yes Ma'am!
Yang's wife: All of
 you, please be careful!

Cecil: Yes Ma'am!
<end>

<PT0162>
Captain: So you're Cecil!
 I've heard about you!


 Just sit back and relax.
 We'll be at Baron before
 you know it!

 All right, cast off, mates!
<end>

<PT0163>
Captain: We'll thank those
 bastards for attacking our
 homes!
Sailors: 'Aye Captain!!
<end>

<PT0164>
Yang: So, what do you
 intend to do once you
 reach Baron?
<end>

<PT0165>
Cecil: What the--?
<end>

<PT0166>
Sailor: It can't be!
<end>

<PT0167>
Captain: You scurvy dogs!
 Stop screaming like women
 and DO SOMETHING!
<end>

<PT0168>
Rydia: Kyaa-!
<end>

<PT0169>
Yang: Rydia!
<end>

<PT0170>
Cecil: Rydia! Yang!
<end>

<PT0171>
Cecil: ..



 ...



 ....



 .....



 Oh..



 Ooh...
<end>

<PT0172>
Cecil: Where am I?
<end>

<PT0173>
Cecil: Rydia!
<end>

<PT0174>
Cecil: Gilbert!
<end>

<PT0175>
Cecil: Yang!
<end>

<PT0176>
Cecil: ...I'm alone...
<end>

<PT0177>
Porom: Palom, this is
 your department!
<end>

<PT0178>
Palom: Blizzard!!
<end>

<PT0179>
Palom: No problem-o!
<end>

<PT0180>
Golbeze: Come, Scarmiglione!
<end>

<PT0181>
Scarmiglione: -Gurgle-...
 Scarmiglione of Earth...
 at your service...

Golbeze: That Cecil
 could be a problem.
 We should get rid of him
 before he becomes one.
 He's a Dark Knight, so he
 should be powerless against
 your undead. But he's
 climbing Mount Ordeals.
Scarmiglione: Then...
 he intends to become...
 -hiss-..a Paladin.

Golbeze: Obviously, you must
 kill him before he does.


Scarmiglione: Do not worry.
 You can enjoy watching his
 death, Lord Golbeze.

Golbeze: Then go!
Scarmiglione: Yes...my Master!
<end>

<PT0182>
Golbeze: This has become
 interesting...
 Don't you think so, Cain?
<end>

<PT0183>
Cain: Yes..
 But you should not take
 light of Cecil's power...
<end>

<PT0184>
Cain: My Master!
 Let me kill him!
<end>

<PT0185>
Golbeze: Yeah, like you
 did at Fabul?
 Oh, wait...You didn't
 kill him there...
 So what makes you think
 I'll send you?
 Stay here and watch the girl.
<end>

<PT0186>
Tella: So you're here to
 search for Meteo as well?
Cecil: Meteo?

Porom: Meteo? You're..
Palom: Hey, old man!
 Are you Tella?
<end>

<PT0187>
Porom: Call him Master
 Tella! You're so rude!
<end>

<PT0188>
Porom: It truly is an honor
 to meet you, Master Tella.


 We have been sent by the
 village elder of Mysidia
 to...

Palom: Spy on...
<end>

<PT0189>
Wham!<delay><08><06>
<end>

<PT0190>
Porom: Ahem!
 We are to guide Mr. Cecil
 through Mount Ordeals.
 My name is Porom.
Palom: I'm Palom!
 So you're Tella!
 You're real famous in
 Mysidia!
<end>

<PT0191>
Tella: So these are
 children from Mysidia.
 What happened to Gilbert
 and Rydia?
Cecil: When we were going to
 Baron, we were attacked by
 Leviathan...
Tella: ...They died!?
Cecil: Yes...
 And Rosa was captured
 by Golbeze...
<end>

<PT0192>
Palom: That's gotta be his
 woman!
<end>

<PT0193>
Porom: Hush!
Cecil: But weren't you
 going to find Golbeze?
<end>

<PT0194>
Tella: I can't beat someone
 as powerful as him with just
 the magic I have now.

 I was searching for the
 legendary sealed magic
 Meteo...

 and I felt a strong aura
 coming from this mountain!
 Could it be, after all these
 years of searching...?
Porom: That spell is
 dangerous! If someone who
 has lived as long as you
 tries to cast it...
Tella: Yes, I am old! But!
 Even if it means losing my
 life...

 I must avenge my daughter...!


Cecil: ....
<end>

<PT0195>
Palom: Hmph!
 This is why adults are such
 a pain in the ass!
<end>

<PT0196>
Palom: Who IS this Golbeze?!
Porom: You're so ignorant!
 He's the one controlling
 Baron!
<end>

<PT0197>
'-Gurgle-....'



Tella: An evil presence!!



'I'm happy...very happy...
 Killing makes me happy!'


Cecil: Who's there!?
<end>

<PT0198>
'I am your guide to Hell...'



'I am one of Lord Golbeze's
 Four Emperors.
 Scarmiglione, of Earth...'

'It is time for my precious
 undead to feast!'
<end>

<PT0199>
'-Gurgle-...Ah, death...What
 strength I find in it...
 Come join me...'
<end>

<PT0200>
Scarmiglione: You
 defeated me...twice!


 The darkness...I'm
 falling...into eternal
 darkness...
<end>

<PT0201>
'I've been waiting for you...'


'Sadness fills me...'



'...I shall entrust you
 with my power...'


'...Yet my sorrow will
 only grow...'


'...But this is the only
 way left.'
<end>

<PT0202>
'Leave your bloodied past
 behind...Cleanse your tainted
 soul with sacred light!
 You must!'
'To receive this holy power,
 fight and defeat....yourself
 as a Dark Knight!'
<end>

<PT0203>
Tella: Two Cecils?
Palom: What the hell's
 happening!?
Porom: Mr. Cecil!
<end>

<PT0204>
Cecil: Stay back!
 This fight is mine alone!


 In order to atone for my
 past, I must conquer my own
 darkness!
<end>

<PT0205>
'Well done...
 Receive my consciousness...
 Take it...My...final light!
 My son...Stop Golbeze!'
Cecil: P..Please wait!
<end>

<PT0206>

<space><03>Cecil became a Paladin!
<end>

<PT0207>
Porom: Are you all right!
Palom: You really...


Porom: Shh!



Cecil: What's this
 feeling..? It seems so...
 familiar...
 What was that voice...?
Tella: Oh...Oh!!



Porom: Master Tella?
<end>

<PT0208>
Tella: I'm beginning
 to remember...
 I'm beginning to remember
 all my spells!
Tella remembered all the
magic that he had forgotten!
<end>

<PT0209>
Porom: Grand Master
 that he is...
Palom: Hey, Porom...
<end>

<PT0210>
Porom: Mr. Cecil...
Palom: To tell the truth,
 we...
<end>

<PT0211>
Tella: All right!
 I'm all ready!
 Let's go get Golbeze!
<end>

<PT0212>
Tella: What are you
 waiting on, Cecil?
 Come on, let's go!

Cecil: Yeah...
<end>

<PT0213>
Cecil: Gilbert!
<end>

<PT0214>
Gilbert: It's you, Cecil...
 You survived...Thank God...
 I'll...fight too...

Tella: What can you
 possibly do in your
 condition!?
 Stay in bed and sleep!
Gilbert: Master Tella...
 I'm sorry...
 for my weakness...
 If I wasn't so...
 Anna...would be alive...



Tella: ...
<end>

<PT0215>
Yang: Sir Gilbert,
 you must care for yourself
 at the moment.
<end>

<PT0216>
Gilbert: Yang...
 You're also safe.
 Then Rydia is too...?

Yang: I..I couldn't save
 her...
<end>

<PT0217>
Gilbert: Oh...that's
 horrible...


 To make matters worse...
 while everyone is fighting
 I'm stuck here in bed...
<end>

<PT0218>
Gilbert: You are Cid?
 Then you have an airship!!
<end>

<PT0219>
Gilbert: Dark Elf....
<end>

<PT0220>
Dark Elf: YOU-MADE-IT-HERE!
 BUT-YOU-CANNOT-TAKE-BACK
 THE-CRYSTAL-OF-EARTH.

 YOU-CAN'T-STAND-UP-TO-MY
 MAGIC-WITH-EQUIPMENT-LIKE
 THAT!

Yang: Sir Cecil!
Tella: Leave this to us!
<end>

<PT0221>
Gilbert: Cecil and the
 others...are in danger!
<end>

<PT0222>
'You're in no condition
 to be moving!'


'Where do you think
 you're going!'


Gilbert: ...My harp...
 Ugh!


'In that condition you
 won't even be able to walk!
 Don't overexert yourself!'

Gilbert: I don't care...
 This is the only way...
 to save...Cecil and
 the others!
<end>

<PT0223>
Gilbert's Harp can be
heard through the Echoer!


Yang: Oh...
Tella: This warm sound is...
Cecil: Gilbert's Harp!

Dark Elf: WHAT-THE-...
 WHAT-IS-THIS-HORRIBLE-SOUND?
 UGH...ACK, UCK!
<end>

<PT0224>
Gilbert: Cecil, attack now!
 While this music is playing
 he shouldn't be able to
 control gravity!
 Your sword!
 Equip your sword!
<end>

<PT0225>
Dark Elf: URGH! HOW-DID
 THAT-SOUND-MAKE-IT HERE?


 BUT-I-HAVE-THE
 CRYSTAL...WHY-CAN'T-I
 ATTAIN-IMMORTALITY..?

 ARGH!
<end>

<PT0226>
Cecil: You did it, Gilbert!
<end>

<PT0227>
Gilbert: The crystal...
 you made it...
Cecil: Gilbert!
 It's all thanks to you!
Gilbert: No, not really...
Cid: But why did that
 song affect him?
<end>

<PT0228>
Gilbert: While wandering
 as a bard, I learned songs
 that warded off evil
 fairies and spirits.
 I thought that song
 might work. It did...
Yang: And because of
 that you saved us.
Gilbert: No...it wasn't
 me...ugh!
<end>

<PT0229>
Gilbert: Master Tella...
Tella: I know now why
 Anna loved you...

 She must have been so
 happy...It is I who
 must ask your forgiveness...

Gilbert: Master Tella...
Tella: All I can do is
 avenge Anna's death
 with Meteo!
 And I will fight
 for you as well.
Gilbert: Thank you...

Cecil: Gilbert, you are...
 a brave man!


Gilbert: Anna...what you
 said...


 Give your love to the
 people of this earth...


 I'm beginning to
 understand...
<end>

<PT0230>
Cain: Where's the
 Crystal of Earth?
<end>

<PT0231>
Cecil: Cain!
Cid: Where are you hiding!


Cain: Don't get so
 uptight...
 Lord Golbeze wants to
 thank you personally.
Tella: Golbeze!
<end>

<PT0232>
Golbeze: Well, well, well...
 you've got the crystal...


Tella: Show yourself!
Golbeze: You'll find me
 soon enough.

Yang: Where are you?!
Golbeze: I'm on the top
 floor of this tower
 with Rosa...
 As thanks for saving me an
 invasion, I'll exchange her
 for the Crystal of Earth.

Cecil: Golbeze, you bastard!



Golbeze: Of course...



 being the bad guy that I am,
 I can't guarantee that your
 precious Rosa will live...<music><19>
 Better get up here!
<end>

<PT0233>
Welcome to the Tower of Zott!
<end>

<PT0234>
'Pleased to make your
 acquaintance!'
<end>

<PT0235>
'We are the minions of the
 mistress of this tower,
 Barbariccia, the
 Empress of Wind!'
'I am Dog of the three
 Magus sisters!'


'I am Mag, of the same!'



'I am Rag!'



'We're sorry, but this is as
 far as you go.'


'We will take the
 Crystal from you.'


'We will stop you from
 reaching Rosa with
 our Delta Attack!'
<end>

<PT0236>
'It can't be!'



'You withstood
 our Delta Attack...'


'Sister! No...'
<end>

<PT0237>
Golbeze: Well done,
 gentlemen.
Tella: Golbeze!

Cecil: Where is Rosa!
Golbeze: The crystal
 comes first.

Cecil: Rosa had better
 be safe!


Golbeze: Do you think I'd
 harm my bargaining chip?
 Now, give me the crystal.
<end>

<PT0238>
You gave the Crystal of Earth
to Golbeze!


Cecil: Return Rosa!



Golbeze: Rosa?
 Who's Rosa...?
 Cain...do you know
 any Rosa..?
Cecil: What!?
Cid: You liar!
Tella: How dirty can
 you get!
 Death is too good for you!



Golbeze: I have no business
 with you, old fool.


Tella: But I have some with
 you! For Anna!!!
<end>

<PT0239>
Golbeze: You...old...
 bastard...You...used...
 Meteo...
 Argh!
Cecil: Tella!
<end>

<PT0240>
Golbeze: However...
 I have the crystal!


 Let's draw back for now,
 Cain!
<end>

<PT0241>
Golbeze: Cain...?
 ...
 ...

 So my spell was broken
 with that Meteo!
 Oh well, you were a sorry
 excuse for a minion anyway.
Cain: ...
<end>

<PT0242>
Cecil: You're not going
 anywhere, Golbeze!
<end>

<PT0243>
Golbeze: On the contrary,
 I am!
<end>

<PT0244>
Cecil: Ugh...
 Why...why don't you
 finish me off...

Golbeze: You're...?
Cecil: ?


Golbeze: What the hell are
 you...?
 Why...?
 Aagh! My head!
Cecil: ...?



Golbeze: Th...this fight
 is not over yet!
<end>

<PT0245>
Yang: Sir Cecil!
Cid: Are you all right!?
Cecil: Y..yeah...
 But Tella!
<end>

<PT0246>
Tella: I couldn't kill
 him...
Cid: Don't talk!

Tella: I lost myself
 in hatred...I've paid the...
 ultimate price...

 Please, Cecil...
 avenge my daughter...
 and...me...
<end>

<PT0247>
Cecil: Tella!



Yang: !



Tella: ...
<end>

<PT0248>
Cecil: Cain!!



 Cain!
<end>

<PT0249>
Cecil: !



 Where's Rosa!?
<end>

<PT0250>
Rosa: Cecil!
<end>

<PT0251>
Cecil: Rosa...



Rosa: I knew you would
 come for me...
<end>

<PT0252>
Cecil: Without you I
 realized...
 I...

Rosa: Cecil...



Cain: ...



Cid: Oh yeah!
 Gettin' it on!
<end>

<PT0253>
Rosa: Cain!?



Cecil: He's regained
 his mind...


Cain: Forgive me Rosa...
 My words and deeds were
 being controlled.
 But not my thoughts.
 I knew I...
 I wanted to be near you...
<end>

<PT0254>
Rosa: Cain..



Cain: ...



Cecil: ...



Rosa: Let's fight
 together, Cain...
<end>

<PT0255>
Cain: What have I done?!
 All those things I said!
 All those things I did!

 Please forgive me!
 Rosa! Cecil!


Cecil: ...
<end>

<PT0256>
Cid: Hey, guys...
 Could we continue this
 discussion later, say...
 somewhere SAFER?!<music><00>
<end>

<PT0257>
Namingway: Oh, hello!
 Do you want to change
 your name?
<end>

<PT0258>
Namingway: Very well.
 If you ever desire my
 services, please come again.
<end>

<PT0259>
Cecil: Let's go, Cain!
<end>

<PT0260>
'So, you must be pleased with
 yourselves. You've rescued
 the girl, saved the...
 Dragon Knight...'
'Still you lost the old man
 and Lord Golbeze left with
 merely a scratch.'

'And then there's me...'



Cain: It's one of
 Golbeze's Four Emperors!


 Barbariccia of Wind!
<end>

<PT0261>
Barbariccia: Cain,
 you betrayed me...us!
 After what we gave you?
 Why?
 We're both creatures of
 the sky!


Cain: Barbariccia,
 I did not betray anything,
 except my honor.

Barbariccia: To think I
 prevented Lord Golbeze
 from killing you, because
 of a weak human emotion...
 The old mage with Meteo
 is dead. I'll send all
 of you to your deaths!

Cain: You're not the
 only one who can fight
 in the air...
<end>

<PT0262>
Barbariccia: ...Cain...
 It...wasn't supposed to end
 this way...

 The last of the Four
 Emperors still lives,
 but you'll never meet him!

 Die along with this tower!
<end>

<PT0263>
Cecil: The..the tower is
 falling apart!
Cain: Damnit!
Cid: Hyaa!
<end>

<PT0264>
Cecil: This is...
<end>

<PT0265>
Rosa: ...Your room in
 Baron.
Cid: We're safe.
 That impostor king is dead.
Cain: Cecil...



 There's something I need
 to talk to you about.
<end>

<PT0266>
Cid: Aaaah, needed to take
 a load off...
 What is it, Cain?

Cain: It concerns the
 Crystals.


Cecil: The crystal
 from Toroia was taken...
 which means that he's
 taken all the crystals.
Cain: No, he only has
 four of them.
Rosa: So four isn't all
 of them...?
Cid: So the rumor is
 true?!
Rosa: It can't be...

Cain: Right...
 The Crystals of Darkness!
<end>

<PT0267>
Cid: There are four
 crystals on the front
 side of the Earth.

Yang: So there are
 crystals on the reverse..?
Cecil: The Crystals of
 Darkness...?
Cain: Right.
 Most importantly, it
 means that Golbeze has
 only half of the crystals.
Cid: So the Crystals of
 Darkness aren't a rumor...
 Here's an obvious question... Where are they?
Cain: Golbeze knows where
 they are.
Cecil: We must hurry!
 Where are they?
Cain: On the opposite side
 of the face of the earth.
 Literally, the underground.

Cid: How the hell
 do we get there?
 Dig a hole or something?

Cain: I don't know...
 At any rate, Golbeze said
 that when the crystals from
 the front and back...
 of Light and Darkness...
 are all gathered, the
 way to the moon would open.

Cecil: Way to the moon?



Cain: I'm not quite sure
 what that means... but
 apparently this item could
 be useful in our quest.
 Here, take it.
<end>

<PT0268>
Received the Magma Stone.



Cecil: What's this?
Cain: This stone
 apparently opens the
 way to the underground.
Yang: Where?
Rosa: Where would this be?
Cain: I don't know...
<end>

<PT0269>
Cecil: The Magma stone
 is reddening!
<end>

<PT0270>
Cecil: What's that!?
Cain: The Red Wings!
<end>

<PT0271>
Cid: Does it hurt,
 Enterprise?
 Hang in there, baby!
 Daddy's here...
Cecil: We're going to crash!
<end>

<PT0272>
Dwarf King: Oh, you're
 all right!
Cecil: And you are?

Dwarf King: I'm the leader of
 the Underground, the
 Dwarf King Jiott.

Cecil: Where are the
 Crystals of Darkness?
Jiott: So that's what
 they came for.
 We thought you were with
 them, but then they shot
 you down.

 Actually, we were about to
 shoot you down ourselves.


Cain: Are the underground
 Crystals safe?


Jiott: Unfortunately,
 they've already gotten
 two of the four.
Yang: We're late...
Jiott: But the crystal in
 this castle is still safe.


 We managed to drive those,
 uh, contraptions back with
 the Dwarf tanks.

Rosa: So those were your
 tanks fighting with the
 airships.

Jiott: Oh, so you call
 those things airships...
 Wow, the upper world has
 things like that!
 We're really proud of our
 tanks, but they were hurting
 us badly with their attacks.

 Would you assist us with
 your airship?


Cid: Well, I'd like to
 help, but after that volley
 and crash, it isn't going to
 do anyone much good at all.
<end>

<PT0273>
Cecil: Cid!
<end>

<PT0274>
Cid left the party.
<end>

<PT0275>
Cecil: Nobody's here.
Yang: I feel a presence
 here!
<end>

<PT0276>
Cain: It won't open!



'Kya-ho-ho-ho-'
<end>

<PT0277>
'We're the Calcabrina!'



'Our plastic faces...'



'Our cheerful, smiling
 faces...'


'...hides the evil within!'



'We'll kill you...'



'...and bring your heads
 to Lord Golbeze as trophies!'

'Kya-ho-ho!'
<end>

<PT0278>
Cecil: What!?



'Well, well, well...'
<end>

<PT0279>
Cecil: Golbeze...!



Golbeze: Look who decided to
 show up. I really must thank
 you for the other day.

 How could you possibly know
 that I love having meteors
 dropped on my head?

 But now that old bastard
 is dead...


 Before I unmercifully and
 painfully slaughter you,
 wouldn't you like to know why
 I'm gathering the crystals?
 It is said that when all
 eight Crystals of the Earth,
 both the Light and the
 Darkness, are gathered,
 the way to the Moon will
 open...


Cecil: Way to the moon?
Golbeze: Unimaginable
 power awaits there...

 To think I could become a
 deity! But, of course,
 you stand in my way.
<end>

<PT0280>
Cecil: We defeated him!
 We defeated Golbeze!
<end>

<PT0281>
Rosa: Thanks to you!
 Rydia!
 You're so different!

Cecil: How...Why...
 When...You grew up?


Rydia: When I was swallowed
 by Leviathan he took me
 to the Phantom World.

Cecil: Leviathan,
 a Phantom Beast...?


Rydia: Oh, I can remember
 how terrified I was.
 I couldn't even scream...

 But he spoke to me
 telepathically.
 He told me to be brave.
 Their world is so different!
 The Phantom Beasts
 befriended me and trained
 me in Black Magic.

 I can't use White Magic
 any more, but my summoning
 power increased tenfold!

 The time flow in the Phantom
 World is different...
Rosa: And that's why you've
 grown up this fast?
Cain: Cecil, who is she?
Cecil: It's Rydia,
 from the village of Mist.

Cain: That child!?
 She's grown into...
Yang: From a child
 into a beautiful woman!
Cecil: Rydia, why are
 you helping us?
 Your mother...I...

Rydia: Cecil, if you
 only knew what I have
 learned since then...

 The Queen of the
 Phantom World told me
 of a great evil at work...

 I must stand up and
 be counted among the
 righteous.
 I'll fight with you!

Golbeze: So you've chosen to
 play with your life this far?

 Playtime's over...
<end>

<PT0290>
'Right in the nick of time!
 Damn, I hate being so good!'


Rosa: Cid!
<end>

<PT0291>
Cid: ?



 Where's Yang?



Rosa: ...
Cecil: He...in order to
 stop the Giant Cannon...

Cid: Is that so...
 Yang...
Rydia: ...

Cid: Who's the girl?
Cecil: A survivor from
 Mist, Rydia.

<PT0293>

Cecil: What are you

<PT0294>
Cid: When the Enterprise
 breaks the surface,
 I'll seal the hole
 with this bomb!

Cid: Golbeze!



 The Airship Engineer
 Cid has something
 for you, as well
 as my middle finger!

Cid: Listen!
 Hurry to the Castle
 of Baron!

<PT0297>
Rosa: Cid!
Rydia: Why is everyone...


Cain: Damnit...
 everyone's dying...
<end>

<PT0298>
Mr. Cecil! Boss asked us to
attach this hook to the
Enterprise!

Don't worry, it'll only
take a sec!
<end>

<PT0299>
Now you can pick up the
Hovercraft and move it!


While riding the Enterprise
press the action button while
above the Hovercraft!

Now you can go to the cave of
Eblana by the Tower of Babil!

<PT0300>
Cecil: To tell the truth,
 Cid is...


'Pretty loud, right?'



'Rest assured he's not
 someone who'll die easily!'


'Well, we're done here!
 Be careful!'
<end>

<PT0301>
Man: I finally found you,
 Rubicante!
 I've been waiting for this
 day for a long time!
Rubicante: Hmm...have I met
 you before?


Man: I'm the Prince of Eblana!
 The Master Ninja Edge!


Rubicante: Eblana?
 Where is that?


Edge: Don't you dare
 insult me like that,
 you bastard!
<end>

<PT0302>
Cecil: Are you all right!?
Edge: I lost...
 AAARRRRRGggg...hhh...ouch...

Rydia: Rubicante stands
 between us and the Crystals.
 Maybe we could help
 each other.
Edge: Don't get in the way!
 This is personal!
Cecil: You went up against
 Rubicante alone...
Cain: And look what happened!
 So what the hell makes you
 think you can beat him?!
 Your temper, maybe?
Edge: I'm not just some
 hot-headed prince, damnit!


 The Royal Family of Eblana
 has skills you can only
 DREAM about!

Rydia: Shut up!
 Just shut up, all of you!
<end>

<PT0303>
Rydia: We lost Tella,
 Yang, even Cid!
 Why? We're no closer
 than we were!
 And now...we're just
 fighting amongst ourselves!
 Do their lives mean
 nothing to us?
 Are we willing to forget
 what they fought and died
 for just so we can
 argue whose fight this is?
Edge: He..hey now...
<end>

<PT0304>
Cecil: ...Rubicante is the
 most powerful of the
 Four Emperors.

 We don't know whether or
 not we stand a chance.
 But we've got to try.

Edge: ...Okay, okay...
 Besides, I can't stand
 seeing a pretty girl cry.

 I guess I'll have to let
 you come with me...
Cain: Jeez, this guy
 never quits! Hey, Rosa.

<PT0305>
Cid: Aw, shit!
 They're catching up with us!

Queen Eblana: I'm so glad
 you're here!
Edge: Thank God you're
 safe! Oh, mom...
 I was so worried...



Queen Eblana: Edge...
 come...
King Eblana: Yes,
 come with us...
Edge: Where?



Queen: To Hell!



Cecil: Look out!
<end>

<PT0308>
Sylph: We never knew...



 We never knew humans have
 the capacity for kindness,
 nobility, and honor.

 Humans are filled with
 the evils of the world...
 lust, greed, hate...

 But Yang is different...
 You're his friends,
 aren't you?

 If he can call you friend,
 so can we! The Summoner
 among you can use our power!

Rubicante: That bastard
 Lugeie!
 I...don't know what to say...
 I can't believe it...
 experimenting on the King
 and Queen!
<end>

<PT0311>
Edge: Rubicante!
 You...! Why?!
 You son of a bitch!
 You'll pay!
 Oh God, you'll PAY FOR
 THIS!!!


Rubicante: Lugeie turned
 the King and Queen into
 monsters on his own.
 I deeply apologize for that.
 Believe me, I would never
 do such a thing.
 I'm different from the
 others.
 I want to fight fairly on
 equal ground.


Edge: Don't give me that
 crap! Death's too good
 for you!

Rubicante: I like brave
 people like you.


 ...But as long as humans
 become tangled up in
 emotions they will never
 attain true power...
 You are doomed to be
 forever weak.


Edge: 'Human'...is it?
 I'll show you that
 'human' thing...

 ...called anger!!!<music><0B>



Anger brought out Edge's
hidden powers!


Edge learned Suiton and
Raijin!


Rubicante: Oh...so anger
 gives humans strength...


 But not even ice can
 penetrate my cloak of flames!
<end>

<PT0312>
Rubicante: All right,
 I'll heal you!


 Fight me at full strength!
<end>

<PT0313>
Rubicante: Oh...I see...
 Individually, humans are
 weak, but together...
 powerful!
 Now I see how you defeated
 Lord Golbeze...
 I salute you,
 brave warriors!
 Farewell...

Edge: Chamberlain!
Chamberlain: For Eblana!
 ??? Wait a minute!
 Where's Rubicante?!
<end>

<PT0316>
Edge: He's dead.



Chamberlain: Truly?!
 Young Master!
 How your parents must be
 pleased!
Edge: ...I hope they are...
 Rest in peace...
 I couldn't have done it
 without these people.
Chamberlain: You all?
 Oh, Young Master...
<end>

<PT0317>
Edge: Rubicante mentioned
 a Golbeze... Who is he?
Cain: The one that
 controlled Rubicante...
 He's the one gathering the
 Crystals, trying to open a
 way to the moon.

Edge: To the moon?
 What for?


Cecil: There's supposed to
 be something on the moon,
 with unimaginable power.

Rydia: We've got to stop
 Golbeze from getting it!


Edge: Rubicante a lowly
 pawn? So this is all
 because of Golbeze...

 My parents...
 because of him...


Chamberlain: Young Master,
 you have a duty to your
 subjects!
<end>

<PT0318>
Edge: The entire world's
 in danger!


 Plus, I figure Eblana's
 people would like revenge
 on Golbeze...

 Hey, since we're chasing
 that bastard..


 I just might be able to give
 him the warm greetings of
 pissed-off Ninjas...

Chamberlain: Brash as ever...
 Well, don't do something
 stupid, like getting
 yourself killed.
Edge: I get it already!
 When have I ever let
 anyone down?

Chamberlain: Do you really
 want me to answer that?
 Everyone, please take
 care of Young Master!
 Keep him under control,
 please?
<end>

<PT0319>
Everyone: Young Master!
 Good luck!


Edge: Don't worry
 'bout it!

<PT0320>
Edge: Ow!



Cain: Looks like we fell
 all the way to the
 underground...great.
 Another setback.
<end>

<PT0321>
Tella: I am Tella!



 I was heading to Damcyan,
 but there's a powerful
 monster up in the lake.

 I cannot defeat him with my
 magic alone, but with your
 Dark Sword.. I might be
 able to defeat him!
 !?
 Oh! This girl is a
 Summoner, isn't she?
 Quite gifted, I sense.
 The three of us might
 stand a chance...


Cecil: We also have to
 go to Damcyan!


Tella: Then it's decided!
 Let's go to Damcyan!

 airship?


Edge: None too soon

 Let's get the hell out

Rydia: But it's the
 enemy's airship!


Edge: So what?
 I don't see anything
 that says 'Enemy Airship,'
 do you?
<end>

<PT0325>
Rosa: Could this be a trap?
Edge: Don't worry!
 I can smell traps a mile
 away...
 Y'know, I kinda like this
 airship. Hey, does Falcon
 sound good to you?

Rydia: What the hell does it
 matter?
Cecil: Let's hurry and get
 out of here!
Edge: Falcon it is!
 We have lift-off, Houston!

 I had better crap in prison,
 and there I didn't have to
 be nice about it.

 I came through here!
 It's not too far down.
 Why don't we ask them

 I lived...
 I wonder if there's anything
 here that we can use?

Rydia: Queen Ashura!
Ashura: It's been quite
 a while, Rydia.

Rydia: We need your power!
Ashura: Then I shall help
 you...or so I would like.

 However, I'm bound by the
 Law of the Phantom Beast
 World... You must first
 prove your worth in combat.
 Do you have the courage
 and power to challenge me?
<end>

<PT0339>
Rydia...



Even though you are the first
people who have defeated
Ashura, you need more than
strength to oppose evil.
You must possess a mighty
will to guide you towards
the path of Light...

My spirit has tested the
passage of time.
What do you say?
Will you fight with me?

Come back to me Cain...

 But it is of no consequence.

 open the way to the moon!
 Come, Cain!

 praying, a voice came to
 me...

 It whispered, 'Come,
 Cecil...Come to the moon...
 So much to tell you...
 about you, your father...'
Cecil: A voice...
 My father..?
 The light on Mt. Ordeals...
 We must go! But how?

<PT0348>
Damn you!



Ow!!



But we've relayed this
location...


To Lord Golbeze!

<PT0349>
Edge: Sh..Shit...I...lost...

<PT0350>
Rubicante: You have
 confidence in yourself,
 too much, in fact...

 You are indeed powerful for
 a human, but you cannot
 hope to defeat me.

 But still...Maybe you'll be
 able to challenge me again
 someday.

 I look forward to our next
 encounter.

 Don't...you...dare...leave!

 Maybe working together isn't
 such a bad thing after all!

<PT0355>
Edge: Awright!
 Let's go kick some ass!


Rydia: Hey, karate kid!
 Before we do any
 'ass-kicking', shouldn't we
 get back those crystals?
Edge: Don't call me that,

 Uh...so let's go!

<PT0358>
Jiott: So, did you get the
 crystals back?
Cecil: To tell the truth...

Jiott: Is that so...



 In order to get the last
 Crystal Golbeze has to
 break the seal on the cave
 to the southwest.
 It's only a matter of time
 before he succeeds.
 I want you to get the
 Crystal first.
 Luka!

<PT0359>
Cecil: Cid...
Rosa: You've really
 overdone it this time...

Cid: ...I can't fight with

 All I can do is fix up
 airships for you.

Tella: It would appear
 so...I will avenge my

Village Elder: Anna?
 What happened!?


Tella: Golbeze killed her!
 I'll destroy this fiend of
 darkness with Meteo!

Village Elder: No Tella!
 Come to your senses!
 You're fighting with
 hatred and vengeance!
 Casting Meteo would mean
 your death!


Tella: Even if my life
 must end, I must squelch
 this agony I live in.

 Oh, how I cried out
 when I saw Anna..
 lying... bloodied...My
 lovely daughter, murdered!
Village Elder: ...
 Passionate as ever...
 the same as you always
 were...
Tella: You're still ever
 the diplomat...


Village Elder: Maybe so, but
 Sir Cecil has become a
 Paladin!

 If the two of you fight
 together, you may be able
 to defeat Golbeze
 without Meteo.
Cecil: To possibly stand up
 to Golbeze, we need to go
 back to Baron and get an
 airship.
Village Elder: I
 understand... I'll break
 the seal on the Devil Road!
 Go to Baron!
 I will continue to pray for
 you and your sacred light.
 Farewell!

 As I treasured your mother,
 Luka, I treasure the future

 Without this, no one

 You little bastard!


Edge: Bastard?
 I'll have you know, I came
 from the finest pedigree
 available.
 Only 'selective breeding'
 could have produced such a
 perfect specimen of manhood.

Cid: How long did you
 rehearse that one?!
 Who the hell is this
 pompous ass?
Edge: I'm the great Edge,
 The Crown Prince of Eblana!

 Has he been feeling

Rydia: No, but he's been
 scratching his.


Edge: Sh..Shut up!

<PT0369>
Cid: More importantly,
 Cecil, What's the deal with
 Golbeze?

Cecil: We defeated all
 Four Emperors, but he
 has gathered all but
 one of the crystals.
Rosa: It's in a cave
 to the southwest,
 over the lava...

Cain: We stole an airship
 from the enemy but it doesn't
 have the modifications of
 the Enterprise.
Cid: Jeez, you can't
 do anything without me!

 Get over here and put your

Jiott: It was a huge ship
 used long, long ago.


 There's this legend...
 'One Born from the Mouth of
 a Dragon'...

Cecil: !! That's the
 Legend from Mysidia!
Jiott: Mysidia!?

Cecil: It's the town of
 Magicians in the overworld!
Jiott: Mysidia actually
 exists!
Cecil: The village elder
 said he was praying for
 my sacred light...
 The legend on my sword!
Jiott: Could it be that he...



Cecil: ?



Jiott: Is trying to revive
 the Magical Ship?


 Yes...that's exactly what
 he's doing! Mysidia!
 You must hurry to Mysidia!

Rosa: But the way to
 the surface is closed!

 the crystals gathered
 we can't get near the
 Tower of Babil!

 Mt. Ordeals was, nor do I

 But we from Mysidia are told
 to pray for this legend.
 To pray for one with
 the holy Light...
 You may be that person!

 no, for everything on
 this earth!

Palom: Yeah!
 That's more like it!
Porom: Calm down and
 let's go!

Gilbert: This is the
 Antlion's lair.
<end>

<PT0392>
Rydia: Kya!
Gilbert: Don't worry.
 The Antlion is tame.
 He won't hurt a human.
 I'll take the Light of
 the Desert.
<end>

<PT0393>
Cecil: Let's go Rydia!
<end>

<PT0394>
You received the Light of the
Desert!<music><29><delay><28>
<end>

<PT0395>
Gilbert: It can't be!
 Why did the Antlion...


Cecil: The number of
 monsters have been
 increasing as of late.

 Formerly tame animals have
 started to attack humans...
 I don't know if this is an
 omen...
Rydia: Let's get to Rosa
 quickly!
Cecil: Right, let's go!
<end>

<PT0396>
Soldier: Yes sir!



Soldier: The monsters
 have been increasing lately
 though...

Soldier: There's just too
 many of them nowadays.


Cecil: Is something...
 happening?
<end>

<PT0397>
Cecil: Battle stations!

'You're from Baron,
 aren't you...'


Cain: Who's there!<music><2D>



'If you turn back, no harm
 will come to you...'


Cain: Show yourself!



'You still insist on
 proceeding?'
<end>

<PT0399>
Gilbert: Cecil...
 Rosa wants to be with you.


Cecil: ...All right, Rosa.
 Let's go together.


 It's night already...
 We'll leave tomorrow
 morning.

 For the time being, just
 get some rest tonight.


Rosa: Cecil...Thank you.



<space><06>White Magician Rosa

Rosa: I'll be all right.
 And I'm a White Magician.
 I won't be a burden!

Cecil: ...

Gilbert: Uwaa!

<PT0403>
Cecil: Gilbert!

<PT0404>
Cain: Yeah, I guess I am...
Cecil: Let's fight together!


Cain: I intend to.
 But I will be fighting YOU,
 Cecil!
Cecil: Cain!?
Cain: Man-to-man combat,
 Cecil!
Cecil: Cain?

Cain: Kill me if you can!
<end>

<PT0405>
Yang: Sir Cecil!
 Now it's our turn to
 fight for you.

 We must discuss a plan of
 attack, but first we must
 rest.

Cecil: Thank you Yang...
<end>

<PT0406>
Bam!
<end>

<PT0407>
Cecil: That's enough!
<end>

<PT0408>
Do you want to watch me dance?
<end>

<PT0409>
You're awful...making fun
of me like that!

<PT0410>
Yes!<delay><05><06>

King Fabul: I'm sorry!
 So it is the truth.
 But our monks are still
 in training...
 Will you assist us?
<end>

<PT0412>
King Fabul: I can't force
 you...
<end>

<PT0413>
Yang: Take care of things
 while I'm gone!
Yang's wife: Yes, Dear.
<end>

<PT0414>
Cecil: Let's first meet the
 Airship Engineer Cid.


 He develops the airships
 for Baron. He should be
 able to help us.

Yang: I hope he's safe.
Gilbert: ...

<PT0415>
Rydia: Are you cold?
 You're shivering.
Gilbert: No, it's nothing...

 even myself!

<PT0424>
Porom: Palom!
 Our elder taught us to
 be humble!
<end>

<PT0425>
Porom: Anyway, let's go,
 Mr. Cecil!
<end>

<PT0426>
Golbeze: I understand your
 respect for your former
 friend. But I've sent
 Scarmiglione after him.
 He is one of my Four
 Emperors of the elements.
 He promised us a good show.

 What do you think, Rosa?
<end>

<PT0427>
Cain: Yes, Master.



Rosa: Cecil,
 please be careful!
<end>

<PT0428>
Cecil: Tella!
<end>

<PT0429>
Tella: Cecil!
<end>

<PT0430>
Porom: Shut up!



Tella: Cecil,
 why are you here?
Cecil: I'm here to become
 a Paladin.
 I can't defeat Golbeze
 with the Dark Sword...
 I must leave my past
 behind...
<end>

<PT0431>
Tella: Golbeze is the root
 of all evil!
<end>

<PT0432>
Tella: A Paladin...?



 Just as I felt, this
 mountain must hide
 mysterious power!

 If you seek out Golbeze,
 I'll join you!



 Sage Tella joined the party!<music><29><delay><28>

<PT0439>
Porom: Let's go, Mr. Cecil!
Cecil: Y..yeah!
<end>

<PT0440>
Cecil: What happened to
 Rydia and Gilbert!?
<end>

<PT0441>
Yang: Hm? What's this?
<end>

<PT0442>
Soldier: We earned our positions as the Red Wings crew through valor and bravery.

Looting innocent people is an act of cowardice!
<end>

<PT0443>
You got the Crystal of Earth!<music><29><delay><28>

<PT0444>
Cid: It's okay...
 They've got me and the
 Enterprise!

 So you're Gilbert...
 I've heard about you.


 Don't worry about coming
 along. I've got 'em covered.
 Just get some rest.
<end>

<PT0445>
Gilbert: Cecil!
 Where's Rosa?
 Don't tell me Golbeze
 still has her captive!
Cecil: He has Cain
 as well...


 They're forcing me to
 exchange her for the
 Crystal of Earth...

 But the Crystal was stolen
 by the Dark Elf...
<end>

<PT0446>
Gilbert: Cecil, take this...
Cecil: What's this?


Gilbert: In my place...
 Please take it...
<end>

<PT0447>
 You got the Echoer.

Cain: Follow my airship.

 pain to you!

Golbeze: ..!?

Cid: Open your eyes!
 C'mon, you sorry old bastard! Don't die on us!

Yang: Master Tella...
 He's...
Cid: ...Rest in peace...
 with your daughter...

Cain: ...Cecil!
 I...I'm sorry...


Cecil: You were being
 controlled.
 What could you do?

Cain: But...I kept my
 consciousness.
 I... Rosa...

<PT0455>
Cain: She's above!
 We don't have time!

<PT0456>
Cecil: Tella...
 We will avenge Anna...

 Come after Golbeze with us!

Cid: What are you
 worrying about?
 We've got the Enterprise!

 We can go anywhere on
 the Earth in a moment!
<end>

<PT0462>
Cecil: But it was left
 at the Tower of Zott?
Cid: Kids today!

 Always underestimating us
 old folks. I told you it
 was the latest model!

 I put a remote controller
 on it. It's sitting outside
 of Baron!

Yang: Then it's decided!
Rosa: Cid, you're
 really something!
Cid: Aren't I though?
 We'll leave tomorrow morning! Can't search for entrances
 to underworlds without a
 good night's sleep!
<end>

<PT0463>
Cecil: But...why didn't
 Golbeze kill me back
 there...?
 Who is he...?
<end>

<PT0464>
Rosa: What's wrong?
<end>

<PT0465>
<nowindow>
Thus, the Dark Knight Cecil was stripped of his command of the Red Wings.<new>
He and the Dragon Knight Cain were ordered to journey to Mist,<new>
a provincial village which lay beyond the mountains in a valley encased by a deep fog...<new>
Airships...<new>
Flight long had been an unattainable dream of mankind.<new>
These vessels gave men the power to soar through the heavens.<new>
Soon, like all of mankind's gifts, it became a tool of greed.<new>
The country of Baron became the world's strongest military power through their Airships, the Red Wings...<new>
But why would such a powerful country seek out the crystals?<new>
What power do they hold?<new>
Why does mankind corrupt every realization of its dreams?<new>
And why are the monsters increasing even in daylight?<new>
The crystals shed their light silently...

<PT0466>
Cecil: Rosa!

<PT0467>
Jiott: What do you need
 to fix it?


Cid: I can make some
 temporary fixes with
 materials down here..

 but the body of the ship
 won't stand up to the heat
 of the underworld for long.

 I need to return to the
 surface to plate the hull
 with Mithril...

 All righty then,
 I'll get going!

<PT0468>
You got the Crystal of
Darkness!<music><29><delay><24>

Cecil: But...



Palom: You should know
 our power by now!
Porom: Right!

Tella: Don't worry.
 I'll be with them!


Cecil: All right.
 I'm counting on you!
<end>

<PT0470>
Palom: We're not done!
 You told us to help him,
 right?

Porom: Please permit
 us to go too!


Village Elder: Well...
 Mount Ordeals accepted
 you and returned you alive.

 You must have a more
 important destiny that
 I cannot see...

 I would accompany you,
 but I cannot leave Mysidia.


 Sir Cecil! Tella!
 Take care of them for me!

<PT0471>
Village Elder: Palom!
 Porom! Your duty is
 finished!

Rosa: Rydia...
Rydia: -sniff-...

Tella: Quickly!
 We must defeat Golbeze!


Village Elder: Oh, Tella!
Tella: It's been a while.
<end>

<PT0477>
Cain: Can't you lose them!?
Cid: Damn! This airship
 should be faster than theirs!
 It looks like they also
 modified the Red Wings!
 Who'd they get to do that?
<end>

<PT0478>
Rydia: They're gaining!
Cid: Hang in there,
 Enterprise!
<end>

<PT0479>
Rosa: Cid, not you too!
Cid: I gotta do this...


 I wanted to see your
 children, Rosa...
 Cecil...

 But Yang's too polite
 to be by himself
 in the afterlife.

 Go to Baron and talk to
 my apprentices!
<end>

<PT0480>
Cecil: Cid!
Rydia: You fool!
 What're you doing?

Cid: At least call me
 Mister!

Cecil: Yang!



Yang: Tell my wife to

Cain: Open the goddamn
 door!
Rydia: Yang!

Rosa: Please!
 Don't be an idiot!
Cecil: Yang!

Yang: I was honored
 to fight alongside you!
Cecil: Open the door,
 Yang!
Yang: Aaaagh!

<PT0484>
Porom: He's a Paladin,
 all right!
Palom: Although I didn't
 think it was possible.
Cecil: What do you mean?



Village Elder: I'm ashamed...
 I had these two spy on you.
 But it looks like that was
 unnecessary after all.
 Well done, Palom, Porom!

King Baron: Baron?
 heh, heh...who's that?
 Oh yeah, I remember.

 He was that human with
 the overdeveloped sense
 of honor.

 He was an amusing one.. He
 'would never turn over the
 country to such a fiend,'
 and so on and so forth...
 Now what did I do with
 him...?


 Oh yeah, that's right...
 I killed him!
 Hee hee hee hee!
 Mwaa ha ha ha ha ha!!
Cecil: The King!!
 NO!!!


King Baron: Want to meet him?
 Want to see the King?


 Oh, I'll see to that...
 I'm not as pathetic as
 Scarmiglione.

 It's a miracle that a
 carrion-eating animated
 corpse like him was one
 of us four.
 Heh heh heh heh heh!
